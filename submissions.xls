4BMod,t2_wf94wlyy2,t3_1c38p2t,,The popular subreddits love discussing why the birth rate is getting lower and you have to scroll a looong time to find any comments from women that actually say the reason. Men think it’s purely financial reasons," “We can’t afford homes anymore and have no time because of our jobs.” 

""We can't afford for a man to work a full time job and own a wife/house/3 kids and a dog like the good ole days"" <---- yuck

This is the reason men give every time for why the birth rate is low, not realizing that in all societies when people suffered they still had tons of children, the difference now is WOMEN HAVE A CHOICE. 

That’s the reason. Men controlled women and forced us to birth and care for children in most of human history. And now, thanks to the women who fought so long and hard before us we are given the choice to have birth control, make our own medical decisions (sadly not true for many women even today), and most importantly, we no longer have to be partnered with a man to survive.

We are now educated enough to realize that WE matter as our own humans, in our own lived experience, our own hopes and dreams can be priority.

Women are having less children because it’s a net negative deal.

Women are having less children because it benefits men, not women.

Women are having less children because we are educated on the risks of childbirth and do not want to risk our lives.

I haven't been interested in any relationships with men and have been repulsed by them in general, resulting in complete sexual and emotional abstinence for the last 2 1/2 years. I've known I didn't ever want to have kids or get married to a man since I was 14  (i'm 22 now). It just came naturally to me because of how men are and have been. How i've seen them treat women online, how they've treated me personally, how they've treated my mother and my female friends, and how they've treated women who are strangers to me that I see on the news. 

I LOVE that there's a name for it now and that it's gaining popularity because this is exactly what we needed. We are reaching the End Times of marrying and having children with men because of the centuries we've dealt with their abuse and hatred, which has only gotten worse in the era of social media and porn. Historically, when something so detrimental to society happens over a long period of time, there's always a breaking point/revolution. A watermelon can only take so much pressure before it explodes.

However, it's just his opinion. An opinion Benedictine College should not have given him a platform to spew but still just an opinion. As Americans even when it hurts, even when your blood boils, you must allow your fellow Americans to speak. Freedom of Speech is the 2nd amendment to our Constitution and a damned good one. 

While that dickwad Buttlicker had the inalienable right to say all the stupid ugly crap he could think of the 2nd amendment also gives us the same right to say how we feel about it. You can't silence his opinion without putting your own freedom at risk.

Butker is a pathetic excuse of a human being and a weak, grotesque example of a male but he is an American. I respect his rights and would even fight for them.

*So far has this insistence on ignorance or innocence in a wife been carried, that even in these days many who marry young have but a very vague idea of what they are doing; while certain risks attaching to the estate of marriage are in, some ranks of life at any rate, sedulously concealed from them as things which it is unfit for them to know.*   
  
*It is a subject that is both difficult and unpleasant to touch upon; but while it will always be unpleasant, it ought not to be difficult, and I should be false to my beliefs if I apologized for touching upon it. Women, like men, when they enter upon a calling, have a perfect right to know exactly what are the dangers and drawbacks attached to their calling; you do not, when you turn a man into a pottery or a dynamite factory, sedulously conceal from him the fact that there are such things as lead-poisoning or combustion. On the contrary, you warn him -- as women are seldom warned. I have been astonished at the number of women I have met who seem to have hardly more than a vague inkling -- and some not even that -- of the tangible, physical consequence of loose living.*   
  
*I have not the faintest intention of inditing a sermon on masculine morals. If the average man chooses to dispense with morals as we understand them, that is his affair and a matter for his own conscience; if he is so constituted physically that he cannot live as we do, and has practically no choice in the matter, that is his misfortune. But I do say this: that the average woman has a perfect right to know what are the results of loose living in so far as those results may affect her and her children. If marriage is a trade we ought to know its risks -- concerning which there exists a conspiracy of silence. Is the cause to which I have alluded ever mentioned, except in technical publications, in connection with the infant death-rate?*   
  
*Those of us who have discovered that there are risks attaching to the profession of marriage other than the natural ones of childbirth, have very often made the discovery by accident -- which ought not to be. I made the discovery in that way myself while I was still very young -- by the idle opening of a book, because it was a book, was a thing to be opened and looked into. I was puzzled at first, and then the thing stared me in the face-- a simple matter of bald statement and statistics. I remember the thought which flashed into my mind -- we are told we have got to be married, but we are never told* that*! It was my first conscious revolt against the compulsory nature of the trade of marriage.*

_rusuna_,t2_5elyjyyv,t3_1d4lu1v,,Societal push to have children ,"I don't understand how women get so brainwashed into having children, ESPECIALLY  when their circumstances/income/relationship is soooo bad and unstable that it is the last thing they should be doing. If you ask anyone why they had babies it always starts with ""I/we wanted...."" without a single thought about what they are bringing a baby into and expising them to. 

I personally knew someone, an ex bff, who cheated on her husband with a dude living in their buddies garage (I know) and then literally, I'm not fucking kidding, didn't have the space so kept the baby and it's crib in a fucking closet. Some Harry potter style shit. I instantly stopped talking to her and anonymously reported them. 

I also had a distant family member out of state who lived off the grid, but pretty damn low income, in a tiiiiiny, insanely packed house with 3 bedrooms and 7ppl living there including her young kid who has their own room. She got pregnant despite not having enough income to barely feed the family as is, and no space, had the baby, and is now panicking on where the baby is going to live. Her young kiddo is kinda unstable, understandably, and acts out a lot so she isn't comfortable leaving the baby in the kids room making them share. So like....who is going to move out so your new kiddo has a room? Your brother and his gf? Or your parents? They are out in the middle of nowhere an hour from the nearest town. She said something to one of my aunts about building a new expansion onto the house....bit with what money?? She goes hungry half the week. 

Both states abortion is completely legal and affordable, and both couples were prochoice. But did either of them stop and go, damn, it would be super traumatizing to be a kid growing up in this environment and stressful circumstances.....of course not. I honestly don't understand how you can plan so little, and be so brainwashed, that you don't consider things from the child's point of view.

Practical_Rush_6407,t2_lb483g8wx,t3_1d5t5z3,,The 4B movement is real in South Korea. ,"I apologize for my poor English, but I must say that the 4B movement is truly happening in South Korea. I am an 18-year-old native South Korean woman. The movement started in 2015 because of the rampant misogyny in Korea. Men control our bodies, prohibiting abortion, and many women die from childbirth or men's violence.

Korean feminists created the 4B movement to combat this: no sex, no marriage, no dating men, and no childbirth. However, I saw a video claiming that the 4B movement is not true and is merely a wish of Western feminists, as stated by a Korean woman. I was very angry when I saw that video because it is not true.

When men ask me why I don’t want to marry or have a baby with them, I say it's because of the violence against women. So, I decided not to marry, have sex, date, or give birth. Many Korean women don't openly say they support the 4B movement because men accuse them of hating men and try to paint them as man-haters. Therefore, many women just say, “No reason, I just don’t,"" but I am 18 and many Korean women participate in the 4B movement. It started almost nine years ago, and since 2015, the birth rate in Korea has declined. When I ask my female friends if they want to marry men or have babies with men, most say “No.” The reasons vary, but the main point is ""misogyny."" We have witnessed many misogynistic situations in the past decade.

That's why we created the 4B movement against men's violence. If we have kids, we can't work as long as men can, and they complain about it. Their main interest is hating women—raping, killing, and disapproving of women's work abilities. I am tired of this. I want to live by myself. I don’t want to be a man’s trophy wife or pet, and I won’t date, have sex, or marry men if they keep trying to make women their slaves. So please don’t believe the misogynists. The woman in the video is biologically female, but we call that type of person a ""fake dick"" who tries to discredit feminists.

Many women in South Korea are not openly feminist but quietly avoid marriage. I know many Korean feminists fight against patriarchy and have communities for this. Feminism boomed from 2017 to 2020, but many radical feminists have disappeared due to political problems. The government has targeted radical feminists with illegal activities. However, we do not kill men, rape them, prevent them from having sex, or do any of the things they do to women. The main reason feminists have disappeared in Korea is that they don't want to cause problems. This doesn’t mean they deny the 4B movement.

When I was 14, there were almost 1,400 to 2,000 radical feminists in South Korea. It wasn't a small group. Over time, people may have changed their minds, but there are always new feminists. So, don’t believe the fake information about the 4B movement. You need to know that in South Korea, anti-feminism is a huge content market on YouTube. Both men and women participate in this. But there are always two sides: misogyny keeps growing, and it creates more feminists too. We say that men's actions only make women more feminist.

So, I am part of the 4B movement in Korea, and it is truly happening. Thank you for reading.",1717265768.0,,187,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1d5t5z3/the_4b_movement_is_real_in_south_korea/,False

imjustherefornails,t2_qn01g0zv,t3_1ddupzc,,"Men's mental health is NOT stigmatized & the ""movement"" is Incel propaganda. I will die on this hill.","The ""men's mental health movement"" is literally just a ploy incels use.

Their evidence to back the claim that men's mental health is stigmatized more than women's is as follows:

1) ""But the suicide rate!"": debunked on several counts:

A: women attempt suicide 3x more than men, but are only unsuccessful due to different methods. Incels like to claim that they choose different methods bc women are ""crying for help"" or attention, but studies show no difference in suicidiality between men and women. So why do women choose different methods? Well, they choose less violent methods because they don't want to traumatize their loved ones. Women tend to take pills instead of shooting themselves & needing their family to witness their skull turned into shrapnel. Men choose violent methods because they are not considerate. So, in sum, the only reason the female suicide rate isn't 3x higher than mens is because they're more considerate. 

B: Suicide rates are actually positively correlated with privilege, indicating that it is privilege rather than discrimination which leads to the male stats. White people are 3x more likely to commit than most minorities. White men are the MOST LIKELY demographic to commit suicide. The claim that the stats are high because men are not privileged/oppressed under patriarchy too is patently false. If you believe that men face MH stigma based solely on the stats, then you must also believe that white men are the most stigmatized of all. The leading theory for why the most privileged demographic(s) in the world are more likely to commit is that it comes down to entitlement. Privileged people expect everything handed to them; when they see minorities surpass them they feel cheated, they think that the game is rigged against them if there's even a semblance of a level playing field. Their entitlement gives them a victim complex, they are crushed when the life they're believe their owed isn't handed to them. It's the same reason white people and men (particularly white men!) are the most likely to commit mass murders. Entitlement & bigotry. 

2) ""Men dont engage in help seeking behaviors (such as doctors visits)

This is a myth spread from one shitty study. The study found that women were more likely to go to the doctor than women. Incels ran with this and started claiming that it was because ""no one cares about men's health 🥺🥺"". The real reason the study indicated this? It was a shit study that didn't control for gynecologists, yearly pap smears, breast exams, childbirth... The study also didn't account for the fact that women often NEED to seek out multiple opinions because of medical misogyny and gaslighting. Women are less than half as likely as men to have their symptoms taken seriously, resulting in thousands of preventable deaths. But incels want you to believe that THEIR health isn't taken seriously. Okay 🙄

3) ""Doctors don't take men seriously!""
Once again baselessly extrapolated from afformentioned shitty study. Studies on this topic show time and time again that doctors do not listen to women, misdiagnose women, give women less pain meds, and have been found time again to take women less seriously in general. To apply this statement, that men are taken less seriously than women, to mental health institutions is insane. Incels claim that an industry, made by men, for men exclusively, the same industry that up until fairly recently was giving women lobotomies and electo-shock therapy for hysteria, is catered towards women? That industry? Really?


4) ""Men have higher rates of mental illness!""
Yeah, maybe sociopathy.... But women on average have higher rates of mental illness.
Incels falsely claim that the rates are skewed because men just aren't diagnosed, however, this is another fictional claim. Studies that give male and female participants identical questionnaires to dx mental illnesses consistently find that women have higher rates of nearly all mental illnesses. Women have MUCH higher rates of PTSD, depression, anxiety, etc. 

5) ""men aren't represented in mental health advocacy!""

And what is the evidence for that? The mental health advocacy movement made male veterans the face of PTSD when female rape victims are the #1 most likely demographic to have PTSD, constituting the majority of people with PTSD...  Men are consistently centered in regards to mental health. Like this isn't even up for debate, it has been systematically proven that the industry is by men, and serves men. 
Men have an entire month dedicated to their mental health. Please explain where they are lacking representation and advocacy. 

5) ""But what about sayings like 'boys don't cry', 'man up', 'dont be a pussy'!""

What is the evidence that ""boys don't cry"" actually translates into mental health issues for men? When women have more mh issues and attempt more, how do men have it worse in that department? Telling them to ""man up"" and ""don't be a bitch"" is stigmatizing women's emotions more than mens because we are the thing they're so afraid to resemble. Women's mental health is so stigmatized, it's used as an example to teach men what not to be. To remind them to be better than women; hysterical, out of control, emotional, pussies & bitches. In what world does that indicate that women's emotions are taken seriously, when they are leveraged against men to affirm their superiority?

Men's mental health is bullshit. It's a made up issue. It's just an MRA tactic. Because men are wilfully blind to women's suffering, they think that their mental health struggles are so unique & gender based when in reality, women go through the same shit, face the same mental health stigma & more! Because women's mental health IS actually stigmatized on the basis of gender, unlike mens! What's crazy, is even the advocacy websites about men's mental health *struggle* to find male mental health issues to put in their infographics. Look up mens mental health and they will list: depression, anxiety, PTSD, Bipolar, etc. as ""mens"" issues... Yet women have higher rates of these mental illnesses. But it's a ""men's issue"" somehow that needs specific advocacy because they have it so much harder than women....

Over the past few years I’ve started to become more aware (and subsequently resentful) of the way that the vast majority of men treat women worldwide. Wherever there’s a post or comic or anything by someone on how to treat women better, or that highlights inequality or anything that isn’t actively bowing down to men, you’ll find not just a couple, not a hundred, but literal THOUSANDS of men in the comments degrading, insulting, and fighting vehemently against it all. 

I’ve been a member of the 4b community (without knowing it) more or less my whole life, and I intend to keep it that way. 

I ran across this post earlier today, and thought it was so funny/cute, and made the mistake of looking at the comments. Something about this post in particular just really got to me. I screenshotted some of the comments, but I assure you all there’s plenty more vile ones. 

I just…I’m exhausted? Why are men so incapable of empathy? Why are they so aggressive, mean, nasty towards women?

Everywhere I go, I see things like this: men constantly putting down and trying to abuse and use women, fighting tooth and nail against the ones that don’t bow down to them. I also see comments all the time from people with the obligatory “not all men!!!!!” Defense, but when you look at the actual numbers? Of how many women get r**ed, how many suffer from domestic violence, etc, and how many men who know their friends/brothers do this kind of shit and will say nothing about it or defend their bros? 

It might as well be all men. At least half of them are engaging in actively harming women, the other half are defending the first half for it. It’s nauseating.

I wish there was a country where no men were allowed in so I could live peacefully and blissfully away from them. ",1720723684.0,,201,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1e0wf75,False

for me 4B movement is a brand new thing that made me become curious reading about it however I kinda feel articles twisting the actual goal of 4B. 

can i ask some questions from all of you who are actually included?^^ (i am a female too)

1. what makes 4B different from feminism itself (out of the rules 4 no)?
2. what was it made for when there’s feminism? or i should think out of the box?
3. what’s wrong with dating man? or why do woman decide not to date them? (in general cases!!!) 
4. what’s the deal with no making love with men? pleasure is nice with the right person so why did this movement set no $€x with them at all? 
5. if someone gave birth by choice but feel totally comfortable in 4B movement can she join?
6. 4B is against all men or protecting women at all cost?

I was never raised as a fundie however my mom raised my brother and me (my dad never went with us—shocker) as evangelicals and I could relate to many parts of Tia’s story.  I highly recommend it!

Sure, he had a traumatic childhood but that is NO EXCUSE. Also, having been raised in a home where there was physical and verbal abuse against my mom by my dad, having to witness all that and being left with trauma as a result, I just can’t put myself at risk with taking part in the institution of marriage.

greyyskyy,t2_y52l7n2nf,t3_1ep6x5o,,Waking up from the spell we were cast under is what 4B is to me..,"{ Long post }
To me, this movement is like waking up from a spell to the jarring reality. As women, I believe since birth we were all cast under a “spell”. The spell being sold lies, fantasies, words, & ideas. We were so conditioned to be the perfect slave to men.. to beg to be “chosen”, to bend over backwards & self sacrifice your dreams, life & goals to further a man’s in the name of “love”. To stay in abusive, unhealthy, or soul sucking relationships & being so conditioned to accept this behavior because we crave affection, love, safety, security & validation. We got sold fairy tale romances as kids, and dreams of marrying a prince..being reliant and dependent.. while men were sold the reality & techniques to manipulate and bind women to them. 

They were praised for using women, & putting themselves first, taught women are replaceable & that their comfort / needs are paramount.. while women were ridiculed and shamed for asking for bare minimum respect, love, mutual labor, care & affection. We were pitted against eachother to compete for men, & all were once wearing heart shaped glasses dreaming of “the one”. When relationships failed we were taught to internalize it, and feel shame.. to blame ourselves for it. Men, simply moved on to the next without much thought. 

Yet, 4B is the awakening.. and the embodiment of female power. It is the breaking of this “spell” & the refusal to abide by anymore lies & manipulation. It’s the ultimate embodiment of sovereignty, power & sisterhood as we band together to hold men accountable for their actions. 

We no longer fight one another, but lift eachother up. We reject the societal expectations, norms & shatter the heart shaped glasses. In a cold world, we provide eachother warmth, inspiration, depth, community & support. We reach for the stars, & refuse to continue to play small for a man’s comfort. We awaken to ourselves & our truth.. that we are deserving of genuine love & what was sold to us is slavery.. so instead of shouting into the abyss, we turn our backs on a system that’s benefited from our pain and we forge a new one.. a new life, a new sisterhood, a new dream.. a new sense of self not based on what we were told we should be, but who we WANT to be. It’s the acceptance of what has been but a refusal to participate any longer. This is the future, we are the future. This is our power, as every woman that awakens from the spell awakens to her true self & is empowered to forge a new path. 
And it is a fucking pleasure to be trailblazing with all of you. ",1723333871.0,,145,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1ep6x5o/waking_up_from_the_spell_we_were_cast_under_is/,False

Dumbiotch,t2_21jdbs8p,t3_1eqvthw,,Can I be apart of the 4B Movement? Or am I disqualified cause I realized the truth after I had a kid?,"I didn’t realize the truth of men and reality until after I had a baby. No man is apart of my life (or my baby’s) and I have had zero intention of having one back in my life during my pregnancy. I found the 4B movement after I had my baby and I have no desire to have any more children or hetero sex. 

But I saw a post here the other day where a woman asked if she could have kids and be apart of the movement and it got me wondering if I was disqualified for having my baby?

Further, I’ve discovered my truth of being more attracted to women than men (always knew I was bi but never adhered to it due to compulsory heterosexuality and the brainwashing of religion I was raised with). I had realized I prefer women and decided during my pregnancy that if I ever get into another relationship in my life it’ll be with a woman. 

Does all of this disqualify me from the movement? Or am I good to still consider myself apart of 4B?? ",1723513674.0,,1,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1eqvthw/can_i_be_apart_of_the_4b_movement_or_am_i/,False

Deeedeebobeedee,t2_mdtso7rq8,t3_1f2f85s,,Only just today found out about the 4b movement ,"I only just today found out about the 4b movement. I’ve been practising a life totally free of any kind of involvement with cis men for almost two years. My life is markedly better. I’m fortunate enough to be bisexual with no real preference for anyone. I decided on New Year’s Day 2023 that I would entirely remove myself from even flirting with a cis man. Since stopping I haven’t been through the emotional mind games of dating cis men. I haven’t experienced regret after sleeping with anyone, I’ve found love in an open relationship which works best for me, I’ve had the best nights out of my life at queer events for women and trans ppl without the fear of it being ruined by some creepy cis dude harassing me. I have my boundaries set in stone, my body confidence is the best it’s been and I’m happier than I thought possible. There have been other factors, my partner is amazing, I’ve found some meds that have worked really well and I have a great group of friends. But I’ve surrounded myself pretty much with anyone but cis men and it’s just divine. I’ve never felt so supported. I do feel a bit for some of the genuinely kind and supportive cis men who get caught in the crossfire as I do have some cis guys in my friendship groups still who are wonderful people. But cutting them off entirely romantically and sexually has improved me so much as a person. I’m lucky enough to be queer and idk if I still would if I was straight because having that option to be with queer ppl is there for me and I am really grateful of that.

KWANGYAYAYA,t2_g12knzgq,t3_1f2xvq9,,My thoughts on SK men reaction to 4B,"All over the world, there is a war going on between men and women. The issues in SK are only a drop in the ocean despite the seriousness of the matter.

We are in an age where women have choice. This is very different from past arrangements, where little needed to be worked on to get a relationship to last. It could be violent, it could be abusive, it could be neglective. Doesn't matter, that would not break a relationship.

Now, those things do break a relationship, so we are in a time where actually forming and practicing good interpersonal and relationship skills are required for a relationship to work. Sadly, these skills do not exist due to never needing to have developed them in the first place.

I see this overall situation as a broken/failed relationship

Men have been controlling/abusive and now they don't know what to do, so they will continue to try to win women back by force. This will only continue to drive us further away.

This is a very difficult and messy situation, especially with the hive mind like nature of the internet. male/female connectivity and interaction is not just a personal issue. its now a collective issue. women are now a collective and men are now a collective. this is both a good and bad thing.

This issue is serious. It can result in collapse of civilisation. If babies are not born, we have no future.  
But if women are feeling unsafe around men how can you think to force them? its evil and only creates more animosity.

Going forward, if men, particularly SK men were smart, they would stop fighting against the women, and give them SPACE TO HEAL. HELP THEM HEAL. HELP THEM LOVE YOU.

Doing these evil things to them is only making the situation worse. You are aiding the end of our civilisation.  
Women are having a trauma response. A collective trauma response.  
They MUST be allowed to heal in a caring environment if we are to ever repair the relationships between male and female.

We must love eachother!",1724807991.0,,24,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1f2xvq9/my_thoughts_on_sk_men_reaction_to_4b/,False

Vivian_Speaks,t2_dr7n04v8,t3_1foozaf,,I would like to propose a 4B flag idea - more details below,"The flag I created heavily draws inspiration from the South Korea flag since the 4B movement was said to originate from South Korea. The main designed elements I borrowed from the country’s flag were the white background, circle in the center and four symbols in the flag's corners in an X like formation.

Here’s my rationale behind the color choices:

White represents peace and tranquility. Red represents us saying NO. It’s very abstract but I was aiming for a deconstructed big red X turned 90 degrees. I really liked u/ToyboxOfThoughts ‘s idea of having the pink X represent girls saying no to males’s expectations but we ladies need to be bold. We need to give these men a big red X like the ones you get when your application has been DENIED. We need to deny these types of men access to ourselves for our own protection. The physical red lines represent the boundaries we are putting up as women to protect our peace, safety and overall well-being. Green represents safety, peace and personal growth. The shade of green is meant to be vibrant which represents us flourishing by joining the 4B movement. Black is used to indicate the dark side / risks of association with men (abuse, misogyny and other harm). 

*In case anyone is new here, the 4Bs in the 4B movement stand for Bihon, Bisekseu, Bichulsan and Biyeonae. These translate to no marriage, no sex with men, no child-rearing and no dating men.*

In addition to the colors selected, the symbols also hold a deeper meaning:

I used the Latin B symbol instead of the Hangul B symbol to make globalizing the movement easier since English is one of the most spoken languages in the world.

The female symbol can be viewed as representing all women participating in the 4B movement and the circle being not only our community but our safe space. We are growing/healing together. From the outside looking in, the red lines can be perceived as a sniper scope lining up with the safe zone which can be metaphorical for incels/abusers/monsters targeting us for being women and using the 4Bs as tools to control and abuse us. However, From the inside looking out. It can be perceived as a safe space being protected by the boundaries of the four 4Bs we live by. Incorporating this double-meaning design element was inspired by a poem I read titled “Pretty Ugly”. At first glance, it is perceived to be negative and degrading. Yet, once it is seen from another perspective via reading it backwards it is shown to be quite positive and empowering. This is the intention behind this flag.

I wanna know what you guys think of my attempt at creating a flag for us. Please be nice, I’m not good at graphic design but wanted to give making a 4B flag a shot :)",1727216118.0,,20,0,post,https://i.redd.it/mr09ibwa0uqd1.jpeg,False

I just want to kill myself, anything to drive a woman to the point of suicide is a victory in their eyes.

The thought of having to live the rest of my life, every fucking day, just dealing with men who feel entitled to talk to me, touch me, touch my body, leer at me, follow me, grope me and do what they like to my body because they think they own it, I can't do it anymore. Where is the escape??? There is no escape. Worst of all, they NEVER take any accountability for their actions and other men, the ""nice guys,"" will NEVER hold them accountable, instead they'll take pleasure in hearing about my pain. Tell a man about the horrible things other men did to you and their immediate response is to get defensive, blame you, laugh at you and even do those same things to you because in their mind, they think ""the last guy got away with it, I can get away with doing these things to her too, yay me"". They do not see you as a human being and never will, they don't give a sh!t. Why did we ever birth these creatures? Why do we continue to birth them, raise them, take care of them? Just WHY. But no, I'm the ""lying, attention seeking whore"" for pointing out the never ending abuse and entitlement that goes on in EVERY corner of the planet, I'm ""the misandrist b!tch"" because I want to live in peace without having you assault me just for existing. I don't know what to do anymore. How is it that men do don't even know me, feel THIS entitled to me, my time, my energy, my body. Am I not a human being???????

blueplanetgalaxy,t2_dxqyi2wn,t3_1ftwhev,,4B and 4B Allies (Antinatalists),"Hello all we just wanted to let you know we have created a discord server for those part of the 4B movement and those who are allies of the 4B movement (antinatalists). This server is transwomen friendly so TERFS will not be tolerated. 

If you are a women, non binary woman, transwoman or someone who is part of the LBGTQIA spectrum that is an antinatalist or childfree (childfree as in doesn’t have kids/no desire to have kids/adopt/become a step parent) you are more than welcome to join. 

We believe we live in a Pronatal Patriarchal Capitalistic society. Capitalism needs women to birth babies (wage slaves) to keep capitalism going. Hence why this server has a strong antinatalist/childfree stance. 

If Capitalists cared about women’s health wouldn’t be underfunded. They don’t care about women’s period pain, they don’t care about birth trauma, they don’t care about women going into menopause, they don’t care about all the work and effort it takes to raise a kid (it is expected for women to do free labor when it comes to child rearing and chores within the house). Also feel free to look up motherhood penalty fatherhood bonus. 

For years we have been hearing about the birthrate decline ‘crisis’ and governments pressuring/blaming women for the decline in the birthrate. Not ONCE in any of those birthrate decline articles have we heard from any government of any country about how they are going to tackle violence against women. Domestic Violence is More Common than any other Health Problem among Women during Pregnancy

In addition the level of gun violence in the US is unacceptable. Firearms are the leading cause of death of children in the US. Child labor laws are being loosened. Capitalists have made it very clear they don’t care about people (especially women and children).

Reproduction and Motherhood have become Highly Commercialized and Politicized in our ProNatalist Patriarchal Capitalist Society

If any of this resonates with you please feel free to come join us and we’ll give you the link to the discord server.",1727810245.0,,44,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1ftwhev/4b_and_4b_allies_antinatalists/,False

He became even worse when he found out about that as if he was trying to kill me. He finally kicked me out of his apartment and it was for the best because I couldn't even go to the store, that's how ill I was. At the same time a guy that I thought was the love of my life coldly told me that I don't mean anything to him. He was also very patronizing. My whole world crumbled and I realized that men in my life, father, uncle, cousins, ex boyfriends, ex friends only humiliated me and abused me.

Something broke in me and I feel only disgust. They disgust me. I see a predator in every single one of them. I suspect my father sexually abused me when I was 4 years old and I've had some encounters with guys for whom I am sure that they are rapists and I had luck that nothing happened but still... I don't trust them anymore, men in general.

I know it's not healthy to feel like that but after I almost died because of my father's abuse and after the only guy I really loved treated me like I was nothing, I really can't go back to my old self who was naive and trusted in true love. I despise them. It took me almost 40 years on this Earth to realize that they are garbage.

I know it's not popular to tell that anywhere, people are looking at you like you are crazy but I can't change my feelings. I was severly abused and therapy didn't help, my therapist encouraged me to give a chance to a gambler and sadist beacuse she thought it would be better for me if I have a boyfriend. That sadist married my best friend and they both tortured me.

Last guy I talked to online said to me awful things when I was in hospital.

How much chances should I give to them? Because I don't want them anywhere near me in this life. Never again. I would be happy if I could live in a world where I don't even meet them on the street.

I don't know... I've always been a romantic girl and I am not sure what my identity is right now. I declare myself as a feminist but maybe I am just a bitter and awful human being. That's what men been telling me my whole life.

What do I do now? I will die alone. But that seems better than sharing a life with an abuser. And please don't tell me that they are not all abusers because I am gonna puke. They all abused me. When I think about some ""good guy"" I feel disgust too, they broke me completely.",1728689698.0,,9,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1g1n891/men_are_dangerous_for_my_well_being/,False

I am a female-exclusive bisexual woman. I feel inspired by radical feminism and lesbian seperatism. I've read bev Jo's blogs. I feel that celibacy works for me, because I think that relationships aren't worth the hassle. I also feel like relationships can hinder a woman's progress and self actualization. I've always had the fear of getting into a relationship with a shitty person or becoming dependent on a person. You can't guarantee that a person will do their part, or check all the right boxes. You cannot guarantee that you'll be in a good relationship with a good person and be equally yoked throughout the relationship. Celibacy comes naturally for me, since I've always been a quiet loner. I crave solitude and alone time. I could literally be alone the rest of my life with just my cat and I'd be happy.

I feel that many men lack emotional intelligence and empathy, which is why so many of them are against feminism and women's liberation from patriarchy. If it's not broke, don't fix it.

Meanwhile, they love to ignore all the scientific evidence and research around how harmful porn is for your brain and instead choose to defend it based on how it makes them feel. Funny. And women are supposed to be the 'irrational' one's in these dude's minds?

They make it out like women are the emotional, crazy and weak ones who can't take accountability meanwhile they're consumed by lust, 'horny all the time' and stupidly fall for thirst traps, filters, AI, clickbait and the like. They end up squandering a silly amount of money on OnlyFans, breaking up good relationships and homes over pixels. Idk about you but that sounds like being emotional, lacking responsibility and weakness to me. The pot calling the kettle black.

You're destroying your dick and grey matter in your brain with the studies to prove it but somehow they're meant to be grounded and logical? Laughable.

As much as I would love to get along with men or even have an heterosexual romantic relationship with a man, they always disappoint somehow, even the ""good ones"".
They don't seem to understand a lot of things, they lack empathy towards a lot of stuff and they are pretty selfish. When ever I've met a guy in any kind of situation, thinking they might be nice, they are not, they do things wrong and they know, and don't take credit of their consequences.
Even the ""good"" ones, don't seem to understand the problems females deal with everyday and they get away with it ""because they are men"", like really wtf.
The more I know men, the less I want to get involved with them.
They've made me realize they would never be able to understand me fully as a girl can do, they would never be as empathetic as a girl can be, and I feel as much as they want to help girls and feminism, they will never understand.
Even the men in my life I love, I see they will never understand things, even the ones with good intentions.
When I say I don't wanna date men, they told me, I will find a guy and I wold love to settle down, but wtf I know I won't.

I've seen also girl be the ones who first defend some kind of disgusting behavior about men because they are ""men"". Like no, they are humans and they have behaved bad, let them know and take responsibility of their actions.

So a bit of background, though I've always have fantasies about being in a relationship growing up, in my teens and early twenties, there were rarely any men I was attracted to enough that I seriously wanted a relationship with. I've rarely had crushes and most of those faded away quickly. The only time I really really liked a guy, he ended up being a total ass and misogynist. That was at the beginning of this year and is why I'm here now. 

But years before, I never cared too much about pursuing a relationship but I kept getting made fun of for never having a bf. My mom also judges me a lot too and it seems she's given up hope for me. I was also raised Christian and my Dad and most of the men from my culture think it's women's ""duty"" to get married and have children. I fear that as I get older, the judgment from family will worsen. 

Even if I did really want a bf, it's genuinely difficult for me to find someone I'm attracted to and I can't really change that. I even tried online dating after going through a terrible betrayal by some of my only irl female friends which left me feeling lonely and unsupported. For some reason, I thought having a bf would solve that but I quickly realized most men are too emotionally stunted to be any good at providing support. Of course I was not attracted to any of those men and most were assholes, so that didn't last long either. 

Anyway, after those experiences and dropping my terrible friends, I'm back to my initial attitude of not seeking a bf. But part of why I also sought one was the pressure I received from others. If I am to continue this lifestyle, what are ways to deal with such judgement especially as someone who grew up in a misogynistic Christian society?

TinkerTran,t2_ie49270p,t3_1gibzmc,,Idea for USA reproductive freedom,"Ok so I was just brainstorming and had an idea!

App flooding is a technique that has been used to spread the word to advance various movements. WHAT IF we took advantage of this as well?

For example: suppose the targeted app is Tinder (or some other dating app). We could flood the app with fake profiles of conventionally attractive women to capture the male gaze and in the bios EXPLICITLY STATE that no sex will be had until reproductive rights are restored by the government. This will produce the illusion that a large number of attractive and avaliable women are actively denying sex to men at a time when becoming pregnant is dangerous. 

This will likely piss off a lot of men and maybe make them a little nervous about the future of their sex lives.

Thoughts?

Will there be violence? Likely. But there's ALWAYS violence even when women choose to partner & reproduce. Many women who forgo romance & reproduction are women who've engaged in these things and tried their best only to face violence and abuse in the end. I'm one of these women. Some women have seen how bad other women have had it. Several women dont even live to tell the tale. I'm sick of being a sacrificial lamb, to be abused behind closed doors so that the charade of a civilised society can be kept up. As more women join 4B there's going to be more fearmongering. *As usual* we will be blamed for violence but it is not our fault, even if women did everything asked of them by the patriarchy they'll still be abused on a whim. If there's no excuse for abusing a woman an excuse will be made. Stand strong sisters and keep holding the line.

Also baseless fearmongering doesn't help either. We need to consider plans of action instead of hopeless despair. Enough women & girls have suffered worldwide for millenias now.

It has had its ups and downs, I still care about him deeply but not a single relationship I have ever been in with a man apart from one short one when I was 15 has ever not been abusive in some way or another. I’ve had three extremely abusive ones in a row, my relationship from 18-19 I’m still not recovered from the torture he put me through. And my most recent ex used that to his advantage to gaslight me further many times. Men believe they have a godlike power to control women’s realities. They don’t consider our feelings, our sanity, our safety whatsoever when it comes to something they want, or even just something that they perceive will make their lives simpler. I was financially dependent on my ex, we were living together, but the more I imagined our future together the more grim it began to look. I know how to enjoy life. I’ve done it before. I am surrounded by amazing strong women who are somehow all currently celibate and have the same views I do on men and they carried me through this breakup. I didn’t think it was possible. We are now all planning how to support each other by starting businesses together since I am out. My future has never looked brighter. I have no desire to look for another relationship, I know as bad as my ex was he genuinely is better than most men out there and that thought alone has just completely put me off to all men. The way I have been brainwashed as a child to find a man, get married, have children, make him the center of my world, makes no logical sense considering the way every man I have ever met behaves towards women. It’s a lie, it’s a scam, it’s control, and we are worth more than that. I want to be seen as a human. I want to do things with my life without sacrificing so much of myself that I should be proud of.

Vanilla_L0VER,t2_t84f3638,t3_1gkjzaj,,"I get it now, I am TERRIFIED ","Finally figured it out, WHY I just can't help avoid relationships. 

Looking back now, every desire to have a boyfriend has been for social pressure. And it was never to have one, but to have had one. 

Is like I could feel it, that there was something wrong about men. 

Like now I know there are good men. You don't know how difficult it has been to internalize that fact. And open to the idea that if I cross one I could consider give it a chance. 

But I have NEVER met one. Not one that has proven to be one at least. 
And growing up, Like, grandpa? = cheater, abusive, alcoholic. Uncle? = absent father + got with 35 younger girl. Father? = refused child support. Step-dad? = emotionally abusive narcissistic. Other uncle = cheater. Other others uncle= abandoned like 6 children. Other other other uncle= his wife works and does all labor. Other other other other uncle= forced such high expectations, my cousin tried to take her life.

If you ask me, has the life of any woman in your family improved because of her man? NO, absolutely not if anything they made them less wealthy and less happy. I feel like I robed my mom of a brither future cause she became a single mom, so I do my best to be a good daughter. 

Now they ask, when are you getting a man? Like, what insensitive do I have to ever want that? Is terrifying. Like they want me to walk in a dangerous animal enclosure, and hope it won't attack, but then I see the ones that went before me, and they are all missing a body part. 

I don't want to. they won't make me.  I won't let them. 

I just say, ""I will be the coolest aunt "", ""I want to make money fist to give my mom a trip to Japan"" ""Before I want to travel to Ireland"" ""I saving for a house of my own I can't afford a relationship"" ""I want to go back to college"" socialy acceptable excuses.

Tie your tubes. Implants mean nothing now.

Come to think of it, considering they’re criminalising miscarriages, it makes sense that in a few years time you could potentially be charged for having an IUD or implant in the first place. Preventing pregnancy is the same as termination in their minds. Sterilise yourselves. Contraception is not enough.

Comfortable_Land_320,t2_iyl03cs3z,t3_1glab56,,Supplements that can cause an miscarriage ,"Certain supplements, especially in high doses, have been associated with potential risks during pregnancy, including an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Here are some that are typically cautioned against or monitored closely during pregnancy:
	1.	Vitamin A: High doses of vitamin A (more than 10,000 IU per day) can be teratogenic, meaning it can cause developmental defects and increase the risk of miscarriage. (This is very dangerous and can seriously affect you as well)
	2.	Vitamin E: Excessive intake of vitamin E has been associated with an increased risk of abdominal pain and preterm labor, which may elevate the risk of miscarriage.
	3.	Goldenseal: Often used for respiratory infections, goldenseal contains berberine, which is not safe in pregnancy and may cause uterine contractions.
	4.	Dong Quai: Often used in traditional medicine, this supplement may stimulate uterine contractions and has been linked with an increased risk of miscarriage.
	5.	Black Cohosh: Known for its effects on the reproductive system, it can cause uterine contractions, posing a risk of miscarriage if taken during pregnancy.
	6.	Pennyroyal: This herb is sometimes used for digestive and menstrual issues but is highly toxic in pregnancy and can induce uterine contractions, leading to miscarriage.
	7.	Licorice Root: Contains glycyrrhizin, which, in large amounts, can lead to hormonal imbalances and potentially increase miscarriage risk.
	8.	Sage: Contains thujone, which can cause uterine contractions and has been associated with increased miscarriage risk.

If you or someone else is considering supplements during pregnancy, it’s essential to consult a healthcare provider to avoid any potential risks and ensure safe choices tailored to individual health needs.",1730930156.0,,23,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1glab56/supplements_that_can_cause_an_miscarriage/,False

Greedy-Salamander404,t2_16f0mhaq8b,t3_1gld4sq,,Trans man here.,"I understand I am not the target audience here, and my post may not even be welcome, but I wanted to thank all of you. 

I live in a state where I think I will be ""forced"" to detransition. My gender markers still read F, and there is no legal way to change them. My name has not been changed. I am afraid of creating a paper trail for myself if I do change my name and get a passport. I am afraid of posting this.

I am in a relationship with another DFAB person. So the 4B movement does not wholly ""apply"" to me. But I will be implementing its practices moving forward, including decentering other men. I will be forced to live as a girl, or as girl-adjacent as I can handle without wanting to die. I have nothing against women, I love them, and while doing this is painful for my own identity, I want to uplift women and end misogyny.

I will be telling all women I meet about 4B/6B, encouraging them to learn what is at stake. I am scheduling a hysterectomy for myself. I already have very few friends who are men because I simply don't get along with most of them, and moving forward I anticipate being completely uncomfortable around all men. 

I hope that 4 years down the line democracy isn't dead, and that we don't live in a police state, and that I will be able to return to my true self. I do not feel comforted by the things my fellow trans people say. Death before detransition. It simply isn't realistic for some people. And I hate that.

I hate, also, the idea that I will be a man hiding among women. I am tempted to distance myself from the entire concept of gender identity, but that feels like a cop-out. I do not want to scare women or make them think I have tricked them. I will likely keep my identity to myself for many years to come.

But the real point of this post is to thank you. The women who came up with the 4B movement in South Korea, and all who have helped bring awareness of it to western countries.

I pray for a better future.

If we remove rape and physical battery, it's done for them. I know there was a woman scientist who created an anti-rape device. However our movement must allow for anti-rape to be widespread all over the world.

Mysterious-Code-3412,t2_1a2jci0g8a,t3_1gljfhk,,4B= nonviolent protests against misogyny ,"Korean women didn’t smoothly begin the 4B movement from the start. In South Korea, there were many ‘pickme girls,’ and Korean radical feminist debated with them. But eventually, young and smart Korean women realized that they needed to follow the 4B rules to protect their bodies and minds in a misogynistic society.

To help reduce the time spent on these debates, I’d like to share my thoughts

1. No childbirth? You’re not a patriot. ➡️ No respect for women? You’re not a patriot

2. If you don’t have a man (boyfriend or husband) to protect you, you’ll be in danger ➡️  danger from who? men? 

3. If 4B women choose not to have children and only pickme girl do, won’t the world become even more misogynistic? ➡️ No, your mother wasn’t a 4B woman, but you are. That’s the proof.

4. Don’t hate men from your own country! ➡️ I don’t hate men from my country. I just dislike misogynistic fools, and it just so happens that they’re from my country

5. As a 4B feminist, why don’t you care about or contribute to these issues? ➡️ A 4B woman isn’t a free mercenary who protects everyone 24/7. Don’t take advantage of her. B supports B (support 4B women).

I wanna share some posts on the Korean radical feminist community recently. This is an eng translation. 

1. It can be dangerous to publicly proclaim 4B in countries with many incels. In fact, many Korean women can't feel free to say they follow 4B offline. They only feel free to talk about 4B in women-only communities

2. Nowadays, SK feminists are essentially hunted like witches. Korean incels check past SNS profiles to verify if someone is a feminist, and if they find something, they harass the girl like prey. There are no standards. It’s easy to label any woman you don’t like as a feminist. Even if the woman isn’t a feminist, it’s simply a message of ‘display male power + shut up, women.’ This functions as a form of social execution both online and offline.

3. In the Middle Ages, witch hunts weren’t about truly believing someone was a witch. People knew they weren’t, but still hunted them. They were about demonstrating power, satisfying a need for control, and sending a warning to other women: “This is what happens if you live independently, are capable, and don’t rely on men.” One well-known method was tossing a woman into water: if she floated, she was deemed a witch; if she sank, she was innocent. Regardless of the outcome, the woman would die. Those watching this understood the message: “I must never be labeled a witch.” To avoid that fate, they held their breath, acted cautiously, and conformed to societal expectations. This was the real purpose behind the witch hunts, and it mirrors what we see today with the persecution of feminists. Back then, wealthy women and those who challenged gender norms—such as those who aligned with 4B—were the targets. Today’s feminist hunts operate in much the same way.

4. Women are the first livestock and patriarchy is the process of domestication. Women who are not subject to patriarchy are the prototype, and women who feel like ""patriarchy-customized human beings"" are the new breed, the new woman, because they are successfully improved livestock.

5. In other words, in the novel A Doll's House, Nora is the new woman, but in fact, Nora is the archetype and Christine is the new woman.

I see constantly men commenting on horrific crimes against women and girls by repeating those stupid sentences over and over again.

 I'm tired of holding on to any semblance of hope in my mind, I'm realising even more than ever that most simply don't give a shit and even the ""nice"" ones would rather you shut your trap and stop making THEM uncomfortable with your concerns and your hurt.

I always thought that I wanted that perfect romance where I'd feel loved and respected but it's so painfully apparent that no matter where you look, it's just a fantasy in a girl's heart. Why is it we have to be quiet and apologise for being ""misandrist"" when there's irrefutable violence and hatred towards us and our mere existence. Why shouldn't they apologise for being the most vile creatures history constantly speaks of? I don't get it. 

Why are movements like this sub itself seen as extreme or overboard while incels or ""strong independent men"" who say they don't need women are congratulated? 

Basically, I'm mad. I've kept my fears and anger within me out of guilt for being radical or generalising against men. But now? I simply can't care less. Just because I wish a whole half of the world's population would stop committing heinous acts in the majority statistics against the other half of the population doesn't mean I wish little baby boys were killed or that I think it's okay for men to commit suicide. I think that a majority of men's crises arise from their own system of abuse and dominance, but somehow that gets blamed on us being ""raging feminazis"".

I'm so sorry for this tangent but I'm done. Everything I see and everything I hear is doom and terror and I'm done making excuses for the men in my life that think I'm an insane hormonal demon for being so passionate about these causes. I'm sick of having to look back on how I was treated as a little girl all because I wanted to not say anything and be reasonable for the boys even when they'd say horrific things and bully me because that's ""just how it is"".",1730959683.0,,265,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gljy0p/i_can_no_longer_make_excuses_for_them/,False

I heard about this movement. I like the idea - consequences for actions. Full disclaimer - I’m a guy who never voted for Trump because he is clearly hateful, immoral, and criminal.

What I’m worried about is if 4b will be effective, or will it create more resent (thus more opponents and sadly - more sexual crimes). 

I think what people always forget about politics is you win by influencing people, and lose by shutting them out. 

One strategy (alternative) I’ve been thinking of is incentivizing dems in ‘very blue’ states to relocate to ‘battleground’ states to tip the balance. In the electoral college system, if you win by a little or a lot, the results are the same - you get the whole state. 

What has the impact of 4B in South Korea been? Can anyone over there describe its effectiveness? Politically and culturally? I’m genuinely curious. Please share the good and the bad.

Limp-Berry-6501,t2_1ch0d5zkm9,t3_1glr61p,,A hard truth (hear me out) ,"With the awful news about the US election, I have seen a lot of women on TikTok and even Twitter saying they’re joining the 4B movement. I do love how it’s brought awareness to the topic, however i’m seeing some problems due to them not researching

Here are my issues:

- a lot of women on tiktok (comment sections) are saying can they/they are taking part in the 4B even though they have a boyfriend/husband - this goes against 2/4 of the ‘4 No’s’

- theres women out there who are still with their partner who voted against their rights

- the women saying they are joining are saying it for performative purposes and as a reaction to this awful news. I truly don’t believe all these women will do it or actually commit to it because they unfortunately centre men too much. 

Luckily, i have seen creators talk about this already, how these women still centre men and want their validation. They will swear off dating/sex with men for maybe a month and they will go back to their business and the ladies who are practicing celibacy are agreeing with them

I truly don’t see the 4b movement growing in the states or other countries. What are your thoughts?

I (24f) am from the US and like many women, I’m absolutely disgusted and distraught (though sadly not all that surprised) by the election results. I found 4B through social media and am rly interested in learning more. 

the thing I’m curious about though: if in theory a large number of (presumably liberal/left wing) American women participate and abstain from having children, would that skew future generations more right wing? there are many highly conservative women in the US who will continue having babies, and lots of them (thinking abt those trad wife tik tok influencers ….). even though the trad wife path conservatives have been pushing through social media is clearly bullshit propaganda, I fear a LOT of young women my age are falling for it, and the thought of their children being the future of this country is frightening to say the least …

but then again, idk. 4B seems like a clear and concise form of effective protest imo, but I guess it does make me fear for the state of things in 20 some years when theoretically most of (or at least more of) the population has been raised by right wingers. like I said though I’m very new to all this and would love to hear others’ thoughts! 

also just wanna note, obviously the choice to not have children is a deeply personal one that I am in NO way trying to judge.

It disgusts me and scares me incredibly that this can and probably will influence other countries across the globe - it’s already happening in some.

I’ve seen bits about this 4B movement, and I think it’s INCREDIBLE and I’m amazed at how many people are seemingly already on board. However, it has got me thinking, what actually is it that Trump wants? Is one of his reasons for banning abortion so that the population increases because people cannot access abortion? Or is he WANTING women to do something like this 4B movement to reduce the population? Because surely then it would reduce the strain on the economy with less people? Like Trump is insane, there’s usually always an ulterior motive. Given his stance on immigration and border control, I’m even wondering if he’s trying to make the US look so awful so that people stop moving there?

I understand the core structure of this movement as a stance of absence to show retaliation against the male populace and their inability to understand and defend women's rights, right? 

What I don't understand is why already ""happy"" mother's are becoming indifferent to their children or family members? Specifically sons. I saw a tiktok about a mother saying really mean things to her son, it's been deleted but I thought it was so sad. And some posts here completely abandoning men, supporters and family(said son or brother) included. Even saying, this was a quote from a comment ""I already had his kids 💔 I'm stuck here forever now."" And they had a lovely page with a husband. I know social media is different than in person so it doesn't have much credibility.

Is there another part of it saying mother's can't leave the states? Or am I missing an understanding?

 i 100% support the 4b movement and those actively participating in it by not dating, having sex, or getting married with men. however, i feel like women who are already in established relationships shouldn’t be villainized just because they don’t want to break up with their bf or divorce their husband. obviously they aren’t participating in the movement since they’re with a man but they should still be allowed to support and encourage the movement from afar whether it be through social media or activism/protests. and i feel like women should still be allowed to get with a guy that they believe is their person without being ambushed by radical feminists who simply hate every and all men, regardless of their support for women’s rights. not all men are the problem, BUT a big majority of them are. 

i’m only 19 so maybe i’m too young to really understand, but i support the movement wholeheartedly. however, i also want to be given the chance to go out and potentially meet the right guy for me— does that mean i don’t care for women’s rights? i don’t think so, i think it just means that everyone deserves to meet their true love. i want to enjoy the short life i have, especially since our country is so divided and seems adamant on dehumanizing certain groups of people and it seems to just be getting worse everyday. i understand the importance of fighting for what’s right, and i agree with it 100%, but i think women deserve to fall in love during these grueling times without feeling ashamed. everyone is different. i know my intentions and what’s in my heart. i just hope the 4b movement doesn’t divide us women and actually brings us together, regardless of whether or not you are actively participating or supporting/encouraging.

No-Hunt-6123,t2_9udazrmu,t3_1glzjk6,,“Some women won’t join” does NOT mean “This isn’t worth doing”!,"No hate to OP, but is the [hard truth](https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/s/ghxUtrwLtz) in the room with us right now? Because this take invoked a kinda “duh” reaction from me. 

Also the constant replies to the movement saying that 50% of white women voted for Trump….? BABES we know! And we shouldn’t care about that either rn. Here’s why.

There’s never been a single movement in history that had the unanimous support of everyone it was fighting for. Bffr. When women fought for the right to vote, a lot of women were actually against it. We’ve seen this with countless movements: the civil rights movement, the LGBTQ+ rights movement, even labor rights. Many of the very people who would benefit from them were resistant at first, or forever (nudge nudge at current republicans) sometimes they were even fully opposed. But guess what? Change happened anyway. Feminists did it anyway. Progress was made anyway. So why do we keep interpreting “some women won’t join” as “this isn’t worth doing”?

No. I say those who are about it, be about it. The reality is that some women were never going to join, we’ve been knowing this, and that doesn’t change a single thing for me nor should it you.

If I can respond/expand on things I saw in the comment section, 2 main things will happen which will still make the 4B movement worth doing: 

1. Even those in relationships will start to reflect and understand why the 4B movement is necessary. It will slowly translate into setting boundaries or demanding things in their relationships which some call mini wins. They may not jump in with both feet…but over time, they’ll start putting their foot down in ways that matter. That’s how it works with change - it’s gradual, and not everyone can dive in headfirst (though I absolutely applaud those who can bc you deserve to be fucking celebrated).
   * But while those in relationships might not be fully committing to the 4B movement because they don’t want to leave their bfs/husbands/fuckbuddies, all I ask is that you don’t get in the way of the women who ARE fully committed. Respect the movement and, at the very least, pay close attention to your bfs and husbands in terms of how they react to it. If they’re angry, laughing, or call it “crazy,” really **ask** them to break down why that is. Sometimes, seeing how males respond to women’s empowerment will tell you more than words ever could. Even if you believe they’re 'woke.' 
2. ***AND IM GOING TO HOLD YOUR HAND WHEN I TELL YOU THIS,*** **because it is kinda dark:** We’ve seen time and time again that, whether the pickmes join or not, that’s not who men are truly after. Men aren’t flocking to the “I'll do everything you want King” type of women; they’re actively trying to control & conquer the strong, independent women who set boundaries. That’s why they’re on redpill podcasts everyday trying to humiliate promiscuous women on their panels instead of using their platform to 100% uplift the current women they claim they admire. We’ve seen time and time again that they don’t really want the conservative SAHM; they want to pressure the badass CEO to leave her job and stay home for him. I’ve been unintentionally participating in the 4B movement for 5 years and I’ve gotten the most attention from men in those 5 years, no comparison, because they’re obsessed with “winning” the game that is making me abandon my morals. Just Look on X at their responses to this movement - they’re shaking in their boots because they know it can make a difference, otherwise they would be ignoring it. The male nature is to dominate, conquer and control so by participating in the 4B movement, even if you’re the only one doing it in your circle, is still doing something incredible. I promise.

At the end of the day, the 4B movement isn’t about who joins as much as you think it is.

kitobich,t2_dneyztoq,t3_1glznph,,Realizing I’ve Been Living the 4B Lifestyle Without Even Knowing It,"Hey everyone! I just found out about the 4B movement, and it was kind of a revelation to realize I've been living in line with so much of it without even knowing. About 9 years ago, I became a single mom, and since then, my perspective on relationships and the whole traditional setup has shifted radically.

After dating a bit, I realized I didn’t find any of the current relationship models appealing. Even ""living together apart"" felt like it still didn’t align with what I wanted. Then I started reading about matriarchal societies, particularly the concept of walk-in marriages, and was struck by how much more natural and balanced that sounded. I realized how deeply our modern man/woman dynamics are rooted in patriarchy, especially the emphasis on nuclear family structures. Historically, this setup was created to serve men’s interests—like tracking paternity and controlling women’s roles and choices, often through forced monogamy and expecting women to do the most demanding work in childcare and the household.

Even with feminism, I feel like a lot of our social structures (like courts and custody laws) still end up prioritizing men’s “rights” under a different name. It’s frustrating to navigate as a single mom when so many systems continue to prioritize and enforce these structures. Motherhood really opened my eyes to how much maternal values—nurturing, protective, and community-oriented values—are missing in society, which is so competitive and power-driven.

For years now, I haven’t felt any urge to date or be in a relationship with men. I realized how broken many dynamics still are, thanks to centuries of patriarchal expectations. Most couples I know, even “progressive” ones, seem to struggle with balancing power. Often, the woman still ends up doing more of the emotional and household work, or in some cases, expects a lot from men but wants to make all the main decisions alone. This just shows how unbalanced things still are, with power dynamics always at play.

Recently, I got in touch with an indigenous community from the Amazon that still lives the natural way in the jungle. Seeing how they live—deeply connected to nature and driven by values that honor both women and the land—made me strongly aware of just how deeply our society has been damaged by patriarchy. Their focus on community, harmony, and living sustainably with respect for all living beings highlighted how different things could be, compared to the competitive and accumulation-driven mindset we’re used to in the West.

So, yeah, this is a bit of a rant, but finding the 4B movement was like putting a name to something I’d been moving towards naturally. Even though I’m a mom and don’t fulfill every “B,” I’ve been committed to the rest of them for quite a while already. It’s empowering to know I’m not alone in feeling this way.",1731009834.0,,63,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1glznph/realizing_ive_been_living_the_4b_lifestyle/,False

What if we did the same for 4B? We create chapters to foster local community and support near us.

During these times it’s so important to connect with others and hold eachother up. I’m hoping to contribute in someway and create the spaces I want to see, but I’m not sure how. 

All ideas welcome 🙏

I've  been a huge advocate for human rights for a long time, but this is so much bigger than I ever imagined. I was considering starting a support group or resource group for those in my city that are considering joining the movement. I wanted everyone here to know there are more of us than we may know. But amongst all the conflict, I've been reading a lot of the discourse on here and things feel bleak. It's not going to be easy, but I feel like we need something more tangible to solidify the start of this movement in the US. I honestly don't think that shaming women in long-term relationships who can't join is a way to go. On the same note, though, I think that we need to empower women to respect and value themselves enough to not give themselves away to men who clearly dont care. The only issue is, how exactly do we do this besides support and resources? There is an absolute epidemic of women in the U.S right now who need validation from men so badly that they end up doing themselves and all their peers an injustice. We as a culture are so emotionally dependent on men that most women can't even fathom being engaged with this movement. I suppose maybe its easier for women who aren't attracted to men to do, but as a woman who's also attracted to men, I don't feel like men do enough for women romantically or s3xually anymore that it's even worth it to keep entertaining them.

Known-Lawfulness3965,t2_1chxexf1v1,t3_1gm2i8i,,"Well, it happened ","Throwaway because he's on here and follows my regular account (which is how I think this happened; pretty sure he saw my venting frustration and took it personally). 

Had a disagreement with male partner of many years (13 year relationship, 11 years living together) regarding a friend of his who is a trump supporter. To be clear, I wasn't asking for an ultimatum, I wasn't trying to create a rift in his friend group. All I was asking for is, if he's going to be an ally, he needs to actually take a stand. He needs to publicly say to his friend group that he's not okay with Trump supporters and what they stand for. 

But he won't. He actively chooses to continue socializing with this person, despite the fact that everyone in his friends group is constantly making fun of the guy for being a trump supporter. None of them have the balls to actually kick the guy out of the group, and they just want to excuse it as ""he's just misinformed,"" ""he's not a bad guy, just stupid,"" and ""no one REALLY thinks rape and racism and pedophilia are ok, even if they voted for trump."" It makes me fucking sick that my partner and his friends continue to give this idiot a platform from which to spew his bullshit. He brings ZERO value to my partner's life: he's not cooking and cleaning and sucking his dick, he's not providing valuable work insights, he doesn't have any job or networking value, so I'm really struggling to figure out what exactly partner would lose by taking a stand against that person. 

I took yesterday to myself and just kinda hunkered down in my bedroom, venting my frustration online and generally grieving for the America I thought I loved. I never explicitly stated that I was going ""4B"" with my partner, but I was at least partially joining the movement. I had planned on trying to talk to him this afternoon and have a rational discussion, presenting my side of the argument on why I'm not okay with him keeping that friend around. But that never happened. I didn't get the chance.

Today he cut off my internet and home network access. He owns the house, so I don't have a leg to stand on there. He controls every aspect of my life. I work part time, but I'm lucky to bring in $900/month. I've been trying to find more work, and even dusted off my resume this morning and applied for a remote job. When I got home from work this afternoon, I was no longer able to log into my laptop. That means no access to any of the documents I have saved on there, no access to my resumes, or any of the stuff I need for running my business (thank goodness I have backups online). For now, the only internet access I have is through my phone, which he also pays for, so God only knows how long that's going to last. 

Ladies, no matter how long you've been together, no matter how good you think your partner may be, no matter how many years they have claimed to be an ally, don't make the same mistake I did. Always, always, ALWAYS protect yourselves and your finances, and make sure you can leave at a moment's notice if your partner becomes abusive in any way.

I am safe at the moment. One of my clients offered me a place to stay, and said I could stay as long as I need to. If partner and I are completely unable to reconcile, then I guess that's that. I've been bisexual my entire life, but if we don't reconcile, he will be the last man I ever date.",1731017041.0,,470,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gm2i8i/well_it_happened/,False

Dont be in public like a bar or walking around without another woman with you.
Dont drink at bars or clubs (cuz men like drugging us.)
Know some self defense.
Look up what your state allows for self defense tools like stun guns, guns, pepper spray, etc.
If your in a hotel/motel, bring extra locks for windows and doors and a pop up changing room to prevent being recorded.
Bring a woman with you to any doctor appointment (i was raped by a male doctor at 13 so yeah...it happens...)


This one is...extreme...but i bought a chastity belt JUST IN CASE. You cant be too careful and if this isnt the right choice for you than thats fine but it was for me. I bought a pure steel one for $40 because fabric cuts, legs can be forced open, but nothing is getting through steel if they weren't prepped for it. Cant rape a hole they cant get to!

Exotic-Salad2319,t2_11lux8zv3g,t3_1gm7peh,,I didn’t know if I was a lesbian or if I just can’t tolerate men. ,"I have spent years trying to dissect my sexuality to figure out if I was a lesbian and not bisexual because after being around men for any extended period of time, I realize how much I dislike them.

I’m not a lesbian, I don’t think or care anymore at least about sexuality. But for years I have been described as a “misandrist.” I was made fun of for being a “militant feminist.”  But for all that time I was still desperate for male validation. I still was with men…
Tumultuous childhood with a drug addicted mother (I empathize with her a lot still) who had my oldest sibling when she ONLY 13. She had several children, no marriages, no dads really. She lived a hard life. She put my brother up for adoption, we reconnected and he raped me several times when I was 12/13. No one believed me. I became hypersexual, I sought validation from older men. I moved out at essentially 13/14 to live with my older boyfriends. No one cared how much abuse I was enduring. My family convinced me the the only thing a woman can do is be for a man, my family encouraged me to stay with abusers who said they’d kill me, because “he goes to a fancy university he’ll have a good job and take care of you!” 
I was groomed into thinking that was it. 
I had a child at 16 with an abusive man, who now I’m stuck sharing custody of my daughter with after he abused me while pregnant multiple times. Then I ended up SW, scrambling to make ends meet. I let men abuse me in so many ways I’ll never forgive myself. 
Then I met my now deceased husband, had a daughter at 19.. he was not a great partner but I realized how alone I was after. I became widowed at 22, with 2 kids. Now I’ve found myself once again escaping another man at 25. I went to women’s shelters to get away and couldn’t. He’s not physically abusive but I am tired of enduring men. He is a bad person, bad partner, lying, cheating, concealed his beliefs loser. I will be escaping soon, back to my home state so I’m okay there. 

But fuck, 25 years of never ending disappointment and failure from men. I had an abortion this year in January, i had to do it in secret and we were at a hotel. I found out the sex from a blood test. I knew I didn’t want more children whatsoever, but I found out it was a boy and the thought of what he could become, no matter how well i raised him terrified me. I don’t know any good men. They’re still all socially conditioned to become what they are, misogyny is engrained into our society. 
But at 16, finding out I was having a girl and thinking about how she could end up like me, how likely it it is they could be victimized. I didn’t have access to abortion then or at 19 but god if I knew everything I know now about the world, I don’t think I would’ve brought them into this mess. 

This is a rant and I’m sorry, I just needed to get it off my chest somewhere where I know it’d be understood somewhat. I want to get my children away from it all but I know I can’t shield them as much I want to. I will never let a man back into our lives, I don’t care anymore. 

My goal is to build strong ties with women and focus solely on community and supporting each other from now on. No friendships with men, no more male centered clothing, beauty, etc and I will be teaching my daughters the same.

burntbread369,t2_5bxtlauf,t3_1gm88ie,,I’ve seen people saying 4B is currently becoming a trend. Well this is our chance to make it a trend that changes things. ,"I welcome all the women who are just discovering or considering or adopting this for the first time. We need to remember that we were all raised in a patriarchal society and we are all brainwashed by it to some degree and we all have different timelines for waking up to that brainwashing. Feminists are not born, they are made. This is our  chance to make some feminists. This is our chance to state our pitch, to open our arms, to win over some minds.

Specifically I’ve seen some ire directed at women who are saying they’re going to practice 4B whilst partnered with a man. I understand the annoyance at this because it is a technical misuse of the term and I understand concerns over the term being watered. But I think it would benefit us to extend a little benefit of the doubt to these women. Relationships are not permanent. Women do leave men.  Women who are currently partnered with men coming across this movement for the first time will be hearing opinions and information that is entirely new to them. I’m sure this will lead to the eventual end of relationships for many.

This movement will change the women it reaches, whether they end up fully practicing it or not. This is our opportunity to not only grow the number of women practicing 4B, but also to gain more sympathy and allegiance from many other women. This is our chance to reach women and girls that would normally never be exposed to this kind of thinking. This is our chance to move the Overton window in the minds of the women and girls that are the most occupied by patriarchy.

This is a moment to be optimistic and proactive. Talk to women about 4B. Tell your friends, coworkers, neighbors, dentist, lady in front of you in line at the grocery store. Be forthright about why it’s necessary, how it manifests in your life, discuss benefits and difficulties.

Alternative-Jury-451,t2_4vl4wr3u5,t3_1gm8lfl,,De-centering journey,"I’m guilty of centering men. I lost friends over it, but most importantly I lost myself. I feel like I wasted so much of my youth trying to make men happy with no benefit to me. I tried so hard to get to the point that I am now, and I want to share this message with any woman who has chosen to become part of this movement who might struggle in the beginning. 

Now, more than ever, I am so repulsed at the idea of being with a man in any capacity. Even my male friends I have no desire in seeing. I never thought I’d get to this point and it takes hard work and I’m almost ashamed that something like de-centering men would be considered “hard work” to me. I’d go through periods of seeking male validation, going on the apps and deleting them when I got my fix, only to feel worse than I did in the beginning. 

I swore off the apps, made a conscious effort to make plans with friends and family, and find hobbies I enjoyed. I’m now 4 months man-free and here to tell you it gets easier.

Stats show women enjoy masturbation more than sex, whereas the opposite is true for men. It's literally so easy for women to withold pleasure for men, and it frustrates me that more don't take advantage of this power. I hope this changes over the next 4 yrs.

FantasticBeing7005,t2_10boyyuzb4,t3_1gm9g6f,,Solidarity from South korea,"Hi, I am woman in late 20s from south korea. I watched the news that man got elected again thanks to shameless racism and blatant misogyny. Not a surprise. Also saw lots of mentioning of 4B here and there.  Which leads me to here! And wow, I don’t come to reddit often and english is not my first language, so didn't know 4B thing is reaching people from different cultures. It’s astonishing.

About “4B”, if you ask korean walking down the street, then probably most of them would say they are not aware of it. It’s because any issue regarding feminism is heavily tabooed in this society and the term “4B” is actually quite used in limited communities.

But whatever you call it, It is very much real in korea.  
Everyone is aware of the serious gender issue, increase of incel and result of those, the plummeting birth rate. But we don’t talk openly about it. At least men don’t, because it means they admit the issue.

Some people still seems to not grasp the severe implication of 0.6-0.7 birth rate.  
We’ve never seen this number even during the Korean war, when life was much more difficult and economically challenging. Lower than recent russia’s or ukraine’s birth rate.Let that sink in. Cost of housing and living is NOT the issue. It could be one of many reasons but not the main reason.

On some level, we are aware that the plummeting birth rate could mean a dark future, economic trouble for our country.  
But those who opened their eyes, those who thought ‘enough is enough’, they rather decided to “go extinct” than submit to rampant misogyny, patriarchy, and give what abusers want.  
Look into the numbers of Korean women killed or beaten by men (not even in a relationship) monthly and yearly, then you will understand.   
Look at the wage difference, and incel's astoricities. I’d rather die alone peacefully than be constantly terrified of the possibility of betrayal and violence from men. Naturally females tend to not reproduce in a bad environment anyway, so… what the world looks like lately doesn’t help lol.

If they try to treat you like a reproductive machine or malfunctioning home appliance or something, then punch them with the same method. Malfunction hard, I’d say.  
That is what I think 4B means. Refusing to give any of your resources, time and attention to fuckers.

Anyway 4B is not the only way to fight, and 4B, 6B, or not, I just wanted to say your rage is valid. What you feel is valid. Your body, your choice. Fuck all of them.They will scream at you, ridicule you, belittle you, and if that’s still not working?    
they will rage, cry and harrass you.   
And now even their “loneliness” is your responsibility? Fuck that. Honestly we’ve had enough, we’ve seen enough. Stand still and go on with your life!

Anyway, I’m looking for books/articles related to the core tenets of 4B. I’m not necessarily looking for something explicitly about 4B (although I’d appreciate that, too!); rather, my interests include literature about de-centering men, feminist analysis of sex and dating, and gender studies.

I’ll offer one in exchange: The Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker. I imagine many of you have been recommended this book in the past, but I urge you to read it as we move away from centering men in our lives and toward self-presevation. It’s not a perfect book (imo some of de Becker’s advice lacks intersectionality), but he offers some helpful perspective on male violence and how we can recognize the warning signs early to protect ourselves.

So me and my friends rarely talked about feminism or 4B things in real life. And we did it in silence. with silence.

Look at this right now. Everyone just started whining about the birth rate. like ""We can't sustain our country at this birth rate."" And I was like..... ""wtf am I not the only one? and looks like our sisters are doing their homework well?"" 



Also birth rate in SK is almost 0.7 But NOT ZERO (still 0.7 is extremly low and yes we can't sustain our country) And I am not disappointed. We all know, We never can take the same action at the same time. We are not one thing, idk how to explain. But let's remember this. Unless marriage and having children are your only goals in life, the 4Bs are such an obvious rule. (Since you're reading this, I'm guessing that's not your only life goal.)

SO what's important is that we think and act for ourselves, not worry about whether others will follow 4B movement or whether our actions are meaningful. It already exists in our life. 

Actually 4B was too basic for SK, I am trying to follow 6B + 4T and It's a little tough to follow that, but I'm trying. Even if I don't follow the 6B + 4T movement completely, this is what I do.


## 4B
Actually, once we focused on our careers and the future, this was not that difficult. I also realized none of my friends(high school, uni, workplace) are married. (or dating) and of course It could just be the people in my bubble.

Now It's so natural that my friends and I don't talk about guys at all, but we talk about hobbies and work. We also plan trips and go on trips together. And also travel alone. If you are interested in a system to travel or work abroad, find out about the Working holiday visa.


+
## 5B/ No free talking bar(It's not just about men you meet in real life.)
I avoid evey rage bating contents, comments. also I rarely use social media, and rarely use YT. always remove rage bating shits from my algorithm. 
AND ALSO, we are social beings. Our prefrontal cortex can distinguish between a shitty incel guy who wants a free talking bar and a normal human being.
If you are really lonely and need conversation, use LLM instead.


## 6B/ I don't buy pink tax things
I stopped buying cosmetic things.(Some people need it because of their job, I understand. Just lets do our best.) I also rarely buy clothes. If I need one I buy men's clothing cuz the quality is much better. I don't need to talk about pockets, right? And I don't even search for things like that. If the algorithm identifies you as a woman, it will only recommend those shitty things. Also before I buy something, I always ask myself this: ""If I were Melon musk(idk how to spell that name lol) or whatever dude, would I pay this amount of money to buy this?""


## 4T/ I don't follow misogynistic media
Actually this is tough for me. I'm still trying.
At least I don't spend time or money on media(like movie, drama, artists) that contains misogynistic shit. Instead, I spend more time on content from female creators. 

In South Korea, idol culture(industry) doesn't respect female consumers. But they want women's money which is insane. Unlike them, publishers or bookstores(like amazon?) respect female consumers. (also most people who buy books are women.) So I spend more money and time on books.

If what you follow doesn't respect you, then you don't have to follow it. Some shitty industry don't respect women, even though their main consumer base is women.

ClassLess9796,t2_a1fxklwi,t3_1gmbi9i,,Exercise for new 4b members,"Admittedly, I am new to the movement. I have been aware of it for about a year, but had not dug very deep. I am a Fem Studies grad (2010) from a liberal UC in California and I use to think I was on the more radical side. After what I did today, I realized how delusional I was. 

I believe that there are phase to this process and the phase I am in is ""just for a day"". 

I made it my mission today to decentralize men in all of my actions today. It took constant checking in to ask why I was doing what I was doing. 

1. How I decided what to wear

2. What I did with my hair

3. What content I consumed

4. How I carried my body

5. What energy I gave to men I encountered

6. Saying Please and Thank you

7. What I ate

8. Where I walked

9. Where I parked

10. What music I listened to

  
So on and so forth.

This gave me such a reality check on the subconscious choices I make that are directly influenced by something outside my own desires. I must remind you, I thought I was ""a bit radical"" going into this exercise today. I believe when I was in college, being around so many enlightened individuals, I was much more aware. It seems that as the years have grown between when I graduated and now, those societal norms have wormed their way back into parts of me, without my consent, and today I start again.

So this is my nudge, to give this a try, just for a day. Start with the basics, and see what that mirror reflects.

We also need to be “housing” 4B in our respective communities- outreach to vulnerable women before predators get to them, mentoring/supporting women who are following 4B lifestyle

Avoiding pink tax items, and supporting women-run/women beneficial businesses as much as humanely possible. (If there are some you are aware of, feel free to drop them in the comments)

Avoid giving men even a morsel of attention beyond protecting ourselves. Avoid JADE to online trolls, and irl narcissistic/psychopathic men. Irl ones, try to leave them as quietly as possible. Sam Vaknin has good information on these types of personalities who are the ultimate users, at best, total abusers and potential killers at worst. 

Know the laws in your area and know them well. Be aware of your surroundings, the rejections may get you more stalkers in whatever shade of malignancy they have… carry as many self-defense items, send location to loved/trusted ones, take self-defense classes. 

Share knowledge of known predators in your area to other women to be aware of. 

Make true and meaningful friendships with other women who share your values. You’ll feel it when you don’t feel your energy is drained and instead is re-energizing and invigorating.  ",1731046962.0,,25,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gmc7iq/extension_of_4b/,False

Patriarchy was always about limiting your freedoms so that the elites could control reproduction

Women naturally gatekeep sex and reproduction and its common sense as to why. Being that we are a species whose infants are costly to produce (in resources as well as deadly, painful childbirth)

This is true in many species. The males appeal to the females and many don’t get chosen. 

Patriarchy is man made. There have been many types of societies, but even shit like paternity didn’t even always matter. There were times that elders provided care while both men and women hunted and gathered

Men weren’t solely depended on as providers, builders, and hunters. This is a lie and not even a good one. If men can’t handle a job, they team up. Women do the same. And hunting is something women do to this day. When this topic comes up with a man he often paints a picture like hunting was a bunch of roided out men wrestling mammoths. It’s dumb. Humans fished. Humans caught rabbits. Humans hunted small game.

This is not to suggest men were useless or didn’t contribute anything of value. Just that they overinflate their contributions and undersell women’s to justify their bigotry.

When we began settling and accumulating resources, excess resources are “wealth”.

Eventually we made patriarchy. We started limiting women’s economic freedoms as well as reproductive. Patrilineal lineages were made

When women can’t provide for themselves and can only achieve a living through their connection to a man, they don’t have a choice but to cohabitate

And it men demand sexual and domestic servitude then there’s not much women really could do to resist. It happened, but largely female subjugation prevailed.

Obviously this benefits men. I don’t have to explain why.

But it’s the rich men ultimately who benefit the most. They need a high male population. Men are disposable to them due to their biology. Don’t need many to impregnate the women.

More men means more soldiers to die in war. More laborers they can exploit for cheap labor since they have no bargaining power when easily replaced.

Religion played a huge role in a lot of societies particularly the Abrahamic ones. It’s easier to keep people compliant with slavery when the status quo is ordained by god.

So all those things the men bitch about when they try to claim that they have it “worse” than women are also patriarchy. They blame you for the system you fight and won’t help you fight it

Because they don’t actually care. They’re okay with being used by the rich because part of the deal is easier access to YOU

by now you’ve all seen incels bitching to know end about being “wage cucks” with no woman to show for it due to feminism giving women rights to be too picky

This is not incorrect. It’s the conclusions they draw that are stupid. Free women DO fuck fewer men. The thing is that these idiots are okay with patriarchy as long as it holds up the end of the deal that guarantees them access to women.

They’re not angry that they’re forced to “wage cuck”. They’re angry they don’t have a sex slave at the end of the day.

Birth rates dropped. Away went roe. It’s not coincidence. Your rights only go as far as the population goals where you live. The rich have to pay more to compete for labor. They need you poor and desperate

Rape and incest babies grow up to be slaves too. They don’t need you all to have exceptions or safety or to survive. They just need enough of you impregnated and desperate. They WANT teen girls naive, chasing “true love” and getting pregnant. That’s why our movies and fairy tales give ridiculous unrealistic depictions of love and teach girls that it’s their ultimate goal in life.

Fucking starve the system as much as you can

But be realistic. A lot of cocky attitudes around here that men can’t do anything to make you. All they have to do is what they’ve always done. Make it harder for you to survive on your own.

Fight like hell. End hookup culture. End sex positive feminism (that was always patriarchy disguised as feminism to keep women accessible. It doesn’t mean that purity culture was right, but purity culture was also about keeping you having sex while using shame to subjugate you) make it as difficult as humanly possible to get sex.

And those of you who do end up dating for whatever reason, remember that you are the value. You don’t need to impress them. ",1731067446.0,,13,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gmgxu1/for_anyone_new_please_understand_the_history_of/,False

Correct me if it‘s too generalizing.

 I hopped onto 4b before it gained increasing attention and have friends who are now slowly progressing towards 4b. Most of my friends are bi and stopped dating men.

Back then we used to discuss our male partners and almost every single man gave us the ick. I could swear I‘m straight, but no woman has ever given me the ick, only men. 

And worse, women still decide to sleep with those men who give them the ick. My friends and I look back in shame regarding past experience lol.

hhjghhvf,t2_ded1w0qp,t3_1gml19z,,Some questions about how to organize the 4b movement ,"I would like for the movement to be as widespread and impactful as possible, also with the aim of protecting against retaliation from men. 

So I wanted to start some discussion about thoughts I had on that matter, and seek your insight. 



1. Ways to participate beyond the main tenants

The tenants of the 4b movement as started in South Korea are,
* no sex with men 
* no giving birth 
* no dating men 
* no marriage with men 


I wanted to see if we could come up with many ideas of other ways to participate. So that women that can’t given they’re already in relationships can contribute, and so that it can ramp up the impact given our country is so large and many women won’t participate. 

And then we can consolidate those into a cohesive list of points. 


Ways like 
-avoiding consuming media and other products made by men
-etc.

I remember that with boycotting companies, people did creative ways to sabotage them such as clicking all of their ads and going on their websites without purchasing to mess up their targeting analytics. 
Creative ideas like that would be helpful. 


And then that brings me to my second point.




2. How to go about spreading awareness about it and how to particle in an organized and safe way 

I thought having the key information about what 4b is, why to join it, and ways to contribute, and maybe a QR code to a website would be good to have on a pamphlet, and these be spread around everywhere.

However, I also have concern that it would get into the attention of men that will come after women they see placing the pamphlets.

Is there another way to spread the information in mass? I know there’s the option to spread online, but then what if a woman’s husband sees she’s posting about it? 

Like what guerrilla marketing campaign tactics can we do ? 
How can we convince other women to participate as well, once they are aware of the movement? 


3. How to keep momentum of the movement 
How to keep this going? Feelings are high right now so there’s talk about the 4b movement, but it’ll take time to organize it and spread awareness of it. Are there ways to keep momentum until that happens and until we can make meaningful impacts? Because change does need to happen. I don’t want it to die down. 

Would a way to quantify or demonstrate the impact the movement is making be helpful? How can that be done? 


4. Any other ideas or thoughts you have regarding making the movement gain momentum and impact and such 
-I saw there are people wearing blue bracelets to show support. I also saw that some people said it could be dangerous to label oneself as a supporter. 


-if there are men that are genuinely good and not lying about supporting women, and they want to participate, is there anything they can do? 


Thank you.

pickyourpoiz,t2_1cjom88w17,t3_1gml32b,,It seems like women are learning they can’t win dealing with men. Will they continue to lose or not play? ,"Women keep oscillating between liberal feminist, traditional, and Machiavellian tactics to try to “win” with men and failing.

Women embrace egalitarianism in relationships, only to find themselves doing the majority of housework and childrearing even though they work the same amount as their husbands. They try to do casual sex but their situationships don’t care about their orgasms, sexual health, or consent. 

They turn to traditionalism, consuming content from trad wife influencers who sell them a lifestyle of feminine leisure that is in reality only available to the lucky few and may not even be leisure at all. 

They consider sugaring before realizing they need a hardy soul for that life because you really do have to give up the sugar to depraved old men.

They become pick-me manosphere co-signers but a lot of them remain just as unmarried and childless as the women they look down on because none of their supporters can or are willing to give them marriage and motherhood. 

Women are exploring every avenue to try and maximize the benefits from dealing with men and failing. Being fair to them. Attempting to exploit them. Trying to appeal to them. And none of it is really working. The reasons why are debatable and endless. 

It seems the only thing holding women back from accepting the futility of it all is the understandable desire for companionship and male validation given the fact that most women are heterosexual and are still waiting for the white picket fence they were told they would have.

Imagine the collective strength and unity if every woman joined in—a radical visual statement about reclaiming self-image and challenging conformity.
Historically, protest movements that use self-expression to confront oppressive standards have made real impact.

I‘m not sure if I‘m getting the order right but, it‘s essentially three additional rules which imo are especially relevant for women who are in relationships or married. Everyone can engage in these. I would like to credit the poster who explained them, at the same time I don‘t want to expose them, so yeah.

1. Support women who are doing 4B, so they are able to continue in 4B. This way women don‘t opt to partner up with a man out of desperation/poverty.

2. Refuse to engage in anything that would fall under pink tax, especially the beauty industry. It is run largely by men, especially large corporations, it is known to be bad for our mental health etc… us disengaging could bankrupt entire industries. Also, boycott companies with misogynist policies and instead choose to buy from women founded and women owned companies.

3. Do not do emotional labour for men, especially toxic and sexist men online. Don’t argue, don’t explain, don’t reply, don‘t baby them, don‘t try to reason or go to their platforms to respond to their posts. Their engagement is usually done in bad faith, to waste your time, to get a rise out of you and get a reaction in return. For many men, a negative reaction from a woman is still better than no reaction at all. Instead ignore, block, disengage, delete and save your energy. 

Don‘t forget that 4B/7B is about you, not about provoking, getting a rise out of or changing men. It‘s about re-centering yourself, your autonomy, your body.",1731085578.0,,210,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gmngkf/dont_forget_about_7b/,False

This is a famous article by Womad, a Korean radical feminist site that has been active since 2016, creating and spreading 4B movements and 4B6T movements.

Remember that all XY's nature is the same even if they act sweet and tell you love. They've been exploiting women throughout human's whole history.

The only differences with 4b are that you wouldn't bring any new children into the world that don't already exist, and you wouldn't allow men to visit for sex or companionship. But i still think it's a viable and hopeful way forward, especially for women who aren't financially privileged to live alone, and in previous decades would be pressured to attach themselves to a man for security.

I live with my little sister and we both experience such harmony compared to living with male partners. She is courteous, thoughtful, hardworking, understanding, and communicates so well. The house smells and looks amazing and i don't have to do it all myself. Highly recommend, 10/10.

fedthefup2024,t2_1ck9gcwzl7,t3_1gmsrzd,,I'm done with men. I understand the assignment now. ,"Something life-altering has shifted for me after this election. I'm learning about this community currently as an advocate/ally (I'm married to a man, no kids) and I'm honestly ready to level up. To engage completely in stone-cold denial of the existence of men, including the act of leaving my marriage.

I see now THIS IS THE ONLY POWER I HAVE. To invalidate the existence of men in the same way they have made us invisible, enslaved, less-than, ridiculed, ostracized, abused, raped, murdered, humiliated, denied. What am I forgetting?

My rage is palpable yet calm. I UNDERSTAND THE ASSIGNMENT NOW. Here are the things I'm committing to:

I will no longer wear makeup

I will no longer clothe myself in consideration of the male gaze (fucking hate it anyway)

I will shield my eyes and hair in public places so as not to give men the privilege of seeing my femininity - and my body, too, if I feel like. It's my choice.

I will not GET OUT OF THE WAY of men, whether in grocery store aisles, traffic, crowds, or walking down the damn street. If our bodies make contact, that is your fault, not mine. It's not my job to move or make myself smaller.

I will not greet men

I will not look men in the eye

I will not verbally acknowledge men unless absolutely necessary

I will unfollow all male content creators

I will no longer read male authors

I will no longer listen to male podcasters

I will not shave my body parts unless I want to

I will not pluck my chin hairs unless I want to

I will do everything in my power to patronize only women-owned businesses

I will not smile at men

I will not laugh at their jokes

I will not be friends with men

I will not have sex with men

I will not engage in emotional labor for men by babying them, explaining things to them, or trying to get them to see the error in their ways

I will not abide by the pink tax

**This is it, sisters. This is the moment we organize. This is the moment we mobilize.** It's happening. Let us find the underground spaces off of social media, too, because they are coming for us here.

I DO NOT CONSENT to live in a world where I am not equal. I do not consent. *We* do not consent.

You know what's cool, too? (This part is for all our enemies who might read this, so please bear with me). My husband *supports* my leaving. I explained my dilemma. I validated that he's one of the ""good ones,"" but that's not enough. That my actions to denounce men are ***all I have.*** And he supports me in giving up our marriage for it.

So no - we're not just a community of unhinged women who are trying to decentralize men. Some of our former husbands, boyfriends or partners are even supporting us in this. They support us fighting this fight even if it means they lose us.

So. This isn't an ""if."" It's a ""when."" This is happening. Do not give up. Do not be passive. Do not listen to bullshit rhetoric about feeling your feelings and protesting peacefully.

thebastardking21,t2_6ard2dp,t3_1gmt03n,,6B Economic Resistance,"So, a specific thing I have seen in the two additional Bs is avoiding sexist products and B should support B. The problem is, in America, 'woman owned' and 'B supports B' are not the same thing. Most of the women I know who voted for Trump were upper middle class, either in high ranking positions in corporations or business owners themselves.

Initially, as a member of the LGBT community, I told them my concerns about the elections, and what it meant for women and my fellow LGBT members, and I was shocked to find out how many of them voted for Trump. These were people I thought I could trust. Then I saw some posts on anti-work and Boomers Being Fools that showed that a significant number of the white women who voted for Trump are the upper class types who are in positions of economic power.

Does anyone know of a good way to track which businesses are actually good for women's rights? ""Woman Owned"" is not going to be sufficient in America. Obviously large corporations are going to be outed easily, but is there a website where people can better track safe and unsafe businesses by state or region?",1731099702.0,,21,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gmt03n/6b_economic_resistance/,False

There is no concept of nation among women.I will explain the deeper meaning behind this in another article. Now I want to say is no matter which country, man trys their best to forces us to trouble ourselves.

They taught us that women need to be 

1.Loved
  We women need someone to love us. If you haven't been in a relationship before the age of 20, no one wants you. If you haven't been loved by a man, you are not sexy enough or charming enough. 
  Therefore, men force women to compete through their own standards. This has greatly hindered the development of female friendships. And Women are driven to conform to society's standards, even though it's harmful to their bodies.

2. Harmless
   
   All those standards: Lose weight to a certain extent, Wearing high heels to improve your body proportions, Judge the beauty of every part of the face，etc. is to ensure you women must be beauty and harmless,  no power which means men can controll well.
  
  That's why the beauty industry is so prosperous. No matter how poor the woman is, she will always spend money to dress herself up according to social standards. And men spent their money to improve skills.

women have finally realized they rather be childless and not married even if it means being judged rather than be trapped with a husband and kids. men's response to that isn't to better themselves but to entrap women with children, hence voting for Trump and hoping for abortion bans. for all the American ladies, let this election not only fill you with sadness but to fill you with anger.

men CRAVE women's attention. they desperately need it. only now they realized they'll get it easier if it's negative than positive (guess it's too much work to work on yourself). that's why they hold signs saying sexist things or say them straight to your face. they want to see your reaction, they want to be noticed by you. women can completely stop surrounding themselves with men and they still won't feel lonely. however if there is no woman in men's lives then they feel the loneliness. I mean the women who voted for Trump or maybe didn't even bother to vote at all will deal with such men. but you don't have to. don't let anyone tell you that you owe men, who don't want you to have rights, your attention. stop finally giving them the benefit of the doubt. whether it's strange men or your close ones, they don't see you as equal. why should you surround yourself with someone like that?

koreamanagain,t2_17vdeykhls,t3_1gmzy0k,,4B movement Expended into 7B,"Hi Im Korea Feminist.

I’m glad that many women around the world are showing interest in the 4B movement.

The 4B movement began in 2015 on a Korean feminist site called Megalia, where discussions centered around rejecting marriage and childbirth. Initially, this movement was called BB, short for the Korean words for these two concepts.

Over time, these ideas expanded into the 4B movement, and most recently, through further discussions among Korean feminists, it evolved into the 7B movement.

To help you understand, I’ve attached an image I made:

The original ideas included:
	•	No dating
	•	No sex
	•	No marriage
	•	No childbirth

And now, the expanded ideas add:
	•	No consumption (abour pinktax)
	•	No interaction (with certain men)

And lastly,
	•	B help B


The 4B movement is quiet yet highly effective. Seeing your actions is empowering people here in Korea as well. We are always supporting you from Korea!

glowfawn,t2_6hygrdrny,t3_1gn003f,,Even if you do everything right you are at risk,"I‘m thinking about women like Gisele Pelicot or family members of mine, women who married in their early 20s, bore their husband children, worked (or didn‘t work, depending on what their husbands wanted), were religious and engaged in the community, had perfect bodies and a classy dress sense etc etc… and believed themselves to be in the perfect relationship until it was too late. Who did everything expected of women and did it well, who were rays of sunshine, but got nothing but utter SHIT in return, some of whom are not even alive anymore.

For those who are partnered up, I‘m not telling you what to do with your male partner and I think all women can contribute via 7B (I made a post about it, if you need to know more). But do not delude yourself into thinking you have that one in a million golden retriever man, even golden retrievers can bite. Love your partner, but be realistic about the nature of men. Gisele Pelicot said she believed herself to be in a perfect relationship, her gentleman husband would even bring her her favourite ice-cream and serve it to her in bed on the weekend. That ice-cream was spiked. 

Some people might think the Gisele Pelicot case is a rare extreme, but outside of the extreme abuse she endured, everything about the story is so banal and ordinary. I had never even heard of the mid-size French town she is from until now. The men involved were all ordinary, boring almost, their marriage was normal nothing special about it. None of the men were known to be violent or had prior criminal convictions. In fact it is that ordinariness that makes her horror experience scary, because how are you even supposed to see that coming? What happened to her specifically might have been extreme, but that kind of betrayal is an every day occurrence, it happens all the time to women.

We are deluded into thinking that we have an influence on how men treat us by how we behave. Women are arriving in 4B with good intentions, but it‘s easy to tell they think it‘s about withholding sex in order to change men for the better, to provoke them or show them. The truth of the matter is it‘s not even on us to change them, and it‘s not possible. Men have taken perfect women and completely destroyed them, for no reason other than ""ma dick"" and because they could. There is literally nothing you can do on your end to change their behaviour, it‘s deliberate, they know, they don‘t care and if they do ever change, it will be on their own time and for their own reasons.

Regardless of whether you are in a relationship or not, listen to your intuition, put yourself and your bodily autonomy first, stay safe and never make yourself feel bad for the treatment you received from men. They will try to shame you by calling you sexist names and making you feel you deserved it, brought it on yourself or that there is something inherently wrong with you (compared to other women) that justified how they treated you. But the truth is there are perfect women out there who did nothing wrong and followed all the societal rules for women and still got the same treatment or worse.",1731119519.0,,27,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gn003f/even_if_you_do_everything_right_you_are_at_risk/,False

Excellence is something that girls and women subscribe to as a direct result of conditioning. What I mean by this is that by caring we work harder, more diligently, and with greater sacrifice. So, stop doing that. You do realise that in most professions where men and women work together women are getting paid less and taking up additional duties because of the excellence (care) factor. So, start handing in work that meets the threshold and no more. When you are sick put yourself first. Serve yourself the better cut of steak.

As much as I wish that women do have the equality to go out as freely as men do, this is not the case in these times. Instead of honoring our rights, some would rather take advantage of the opportunity. 

Don’t put yourself into situations where you could be drunk near men. Avoid places of gathering like clubs and bars with men. Go in groups if it’s late. 
You did not have a “deep friendship” with a man if that man chose to vote against your rights to safety.  Let go of said friendships, do not go anywhere with the opposite gender without a female companion. Just block any opportunity where they can access you or attack you when you deny them access. 

Know that there is inherent risk in living alone in these times. Break ins and stalking are sadly common. In these times, I can imagine these cases becoming worse. Know that if something did happen to you, the system will be lenient towards the attacker, time and time again.

If you have children, do not leave them alone with relatives for extended periods of time, or at all. We all know that most SA offenders are people that the child knows, including younger teen cousins or siblings.

And what is 7T? Its help you to practice 7B movement

Here, the prefix “tal-” means “to break free from” or “to shed.”


	•	탈아이돌 (Tal-idol): Breaking free from idol culture
	•	탈종교 (Tal-religion): Leaving religious practices
	•	탈코르셋 (Tal-corset): Rejecting beauty standards
	•	탈오타쿠 (Tal-otaku): Boycotting misogynistic manga or anime
	•	탈국뽕 (Tal-nationalism): Letting go of national attachment, especially when a misogynistic president is elected
	•	탈도덕코르셋 (Tal-moral corset): Rejecting imposed moral standards 
	•	탈효도 (Tal-filial piety): Breaking free from traditional expectations of filial piety


Starting the 7B7T movement right away might feel challenging.

The advice I can offer is this: the core of this movement is about “boycotting men.” Even just beginning with this step can free women from many risks.

Even the nicest looking person can be mad and call you selfish and stupid. Because they think women’s virtue is giving birth and sacrificing themselves.
2. Dont tell any male about 4B including your family member
Even your closest best friend brother or father can get totally upset. They truly believe this society and their male power is rightfully given to them. Think about all these dudes insulting and assaulting women and say ‘I have a wife and daughters’. Your dad and my dad can also be one of them.
3. Do not hurt someone with this movement
If you are married, no need to leave. If you are a mom, no need to disown. Just don’t reproduce anymore. One child is better than two kids. Just be a happy mom and happy wife but have a quiet strike inside and not make another child.
4. Focus on what you like
If you are not wasting and sacrificing your youth, health, money and time, you have more of those to enjoy. I started to learn ballet. I suck and I love it.
5. Focus on friends and family
Friends are crazy important. I have two besties and we are always together. We always joke about living together when we retire.
6. Treat yourself
Less resources to sacrifice for men? More resources to treat yourself. Enjoy investing on yourself your dog and cat and bird and more ☺️

I'm the very first woman in my family that never married, never had kids hast No relationship and never serves any men and refuses to date.

I'm so glad this movement grows and I wish it would grow within the Muslim communities because so many of us are used as literally slaves: taking care of kids, taking care of manchilds and their awful relatives have to be entertained even catered to (who always complain and gossip about you because you are never enough for their king sons).

I was fat my whole life. No one noticed me. Ignored me and the only reaction I got from men was disgust. I remember being jealous and thinking that girl must be a lucky one when she got harassed by dudes that did all kinds of awful things to get her attention in class. I was so so depressed and craved male attention so much that I started even my weight loss journey with the intention of getting a man (I feel so sorry for my former self).

 I managed to lose almost all the weight. But all it did was making me angry. I got so angry at people that thought it's not necessary to treat me humanly and never hesitated to show me their disgust with the way they looked at me. Like now that I'm thin I'm worth it, it's disgusting. Also I feel so repulsed to see dudes spending effort to be seen by me. Like they want me to see that they are looking at me. This grosses me out so much. I don't even highlight any of my surface attributes and have adopted a mean way of looking . It's like I miss being invisible and therefore I miss my time as a fat woman. 

My parents are from Türkiye, and basically the girls are trained from a very young age to cater to men. They learn how to properly cook for men (that's even a term there (koca yemeği which means husband food), take care of everything domestic. Of course girls go to school but there's always a debate like ""yea you have a degree but your degree will not fill the stomach of your husband, so you need to learn to cook"" like whatttt.

The women, especially male relatives moms in particular are very awful often. They don't want you to exist by yourself, so IT IS preferred that a Woman is married and under the guardian of a man. They make young woman that are not married feel like they are not whole and something is deeply wrong with them.

My father is a horrible person, too. Omg. I would bring the best marks home which was back then something extraordinary as a migrant student, he would say it's worthless because you're fat. I would bring home price after price and still he would say it doesn't mean anything because I'm fat. I really think that being fat protected me from so much abuse. Who knows what he would have done if I was like he wanted me.. he made me believe that being fat is the worst thing, but actually now when I'm outside and see girls or women with more weight then irs judt one of hundreds of attributes and it doesn't disturb me. I don't even have an opinion, just one thing visible out of lots of things. That's why I now as Im on the other side I know that people who go out of their way to make you feel bad about your looks weight or whatever are deeply disturbed people and I wish I could ingrain it in the brain of every single young girl. My goal was to get a series of plastic surgeries to remove excess skin, but nope, I'm not doing it because it doesn't look perfect but that's it, it doesn't disturb me.

Express_Channel_1355,t2_zry8bxzcd,t3_1gn3ogy,, 4B with Mental Health or Attachment Issues? Hi," ~ Hey guys! I wanted to start off on a positive note and say that I’m really grateful to have found this community, and you all have given me so much strength over the last couple of days. Keep pushing through! <3 ~



I wanted to talk about my experience with mental health and attachment issues and the way it plays into my decision to join this movement, and hopefully open up a space for others with similar experiences to discuss theirs!
First, a little context. 
I am a 23 year old woman who was recently diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I have expressed symptoms of the disorder since I was around 14, and realized I had it about 4 years ago now. I was very confident in my diagnosis when I first realized this. With a degree in psychology and a bit of digging in the internet it wasn’t hard to figure out exactly what as going on. However, following a very toxic and controlling relationship, I started being gaslit into believing what I was experiencing was just me “looking for attention” or “using my mental health as an excuse”, as my at-the-time boyfriend would describe it. 
For those of you who aren’t super familiar, BPD is a relationship-based personality disorder which is characterized by extreme black and white thinking regarding other people and their intentions, extreme emotional reactions, extreme fear of rejection and abandonment, and distorted self-image. This often leads borderlines to develop what is called a “favorite person”, in which they find one person they become deeply attached to and dependent on emotionally, to the point where many of us consider self-harm or go through periods of extreme emotional anguish when said person threatens to abandon us. It’s not an easy disorder to live with, and in many countries borderlines qualify for assisted suicide because of it. It’s widely known to be caused by childhood trauma or abandonment, and there’s little genetic link to it, though it can play into it a bit. 
How this relates to my diagnosis and 4B? Well as previously mentioned, a couple of months ago I began seeing a man I very quickly favorited. I knew him through a friend who spoke well of him, and we both became attached around 2 months after meeting. 
Things seemed to be going well at first, until I noticed he was starting to sort of “isolate” me in a way. I wasn’t allowed to wear certain clothes, at the risk of “drawing attention” to myself or “encouraging other men to talk to me”. When I would see friends more than twice a week, he’d become extremely upset. When we would argue, he would withdrawal affection and communication fully for days at a time until I would beg him to talk to me. In retrospect, as a fully grown woman, this sounds like an absurd thing to feed into. But this is exactly what this disorder does. It draws us toward very avoidant and oftentimes toxic people in an effort to cling to whatever love we so desperately craved growing up. We become so fixated on this person that we become a detriment to ourselves, and once in this state there is almost nothing we can do to pull ourselves out until it gets so bad that we can’t take it anymore. 
I was lucky enough that he ended things a couple months in because of religious differences, as I myself wouldn’t have had the strength to do it. Once it was over, I had the strength to never contact him again, but to say I was devastated was an understatement. 
It can be so extremely difficult for women with any type of attachment or mental health issues, especially those stemming from unstable male figures or trauma, to stop chasing love or validation from men who don’t care about them. I am grateful everyday that he withdrew, because I know for a fact I wouldn’t have had the strength to leave. But my heart bleeds for those of us that I know for a fact are out there somewhere right now struggling on a deep chemical level to leave men that don’t truly care for them or their well-being. Since all of this has happened, I decided I needed to find support from others like me. No matter how different they may seem at first, men always end up having the same motives. I started my celibacy and participating in 4B around 5 months ago, and it’s been a journey. I still struggle all the time with distorted self image, numbness, and finding my value outside of having a partner, especially one that’s a man. I deal with an almost chronic level of loneliness, and it can be so draining to abstain when you crave that type of affection and dynamic so fundamentally. As a borderline, or anyone who struggles regularly with mental health, it can be so  hard to move past this and see some real change in the way we view ourselves. But trust me when I say, it’s not worth it to stay. 
I wanted to say to any woman who struggles with something similar, you will make it out of this. You will find the strength to leave them, no matter how long it takes. Learn yourself, love yourself, put in the work everyday to grow. Don’t let your mental health define your self image, as it already takes up such a massive part of our lives and perception. You have someone in your corner. 🩷

If you don‘t know this, women across several countries in Europe have complained about being pricked/injected/punctured with something while clubbing. From what I have heard they have not been able to determine who did it and what if anything was in the injections.

The women who report this are not really taken seriously, many are gaslit by medical staff even if they insist on having their labs done just to be sure. As if spiking drinks isn‘t bad enough, now injections are being used as well.

Men need women in their nightclubs, bars and at their parties. The ratio is already lopsided and most clubs and bars have more men than women. That is why ladies nights and free drinks for women exist. We are the product and they‘re trying to avoid having a sausage fest full of angry men.

randomly0987654321,t2_wnf4jxoa8,t3_1gn40qz,,비소비(no consumption),"Hello, everyone!

I’m a Korean feminist, and I’m delighted to visit here after hearing about the new 4B movement thread on Reddit.


Recently, I saw that 4B, 6B, and even 7B have been translated into English and shared widely on Twitter.

Among these, I thought it might be helpful to add a bit more detail to the translation of “비소비” (no consumption).


The 4B movement originally started with two Bs: 비혼 (no marriage) and 비출산 (no childbirth).

At first, it was called “BB.”

It was also referred to as 비비탄 (BB bullets), combining 비혼, 비출산, and 탄탄대로 (a smooth path ahead).

The name was intentionally playful since 비비탄 sounds the same as “BB bullets” in Korean.

You can find Korean feminists on Twitter using gun emojis, which originate from this context.


As the movement expanded from avoiding marriage and childbirth to also rejecting romantic relationships and sex, it became known as 4B.

The term 4B sounds similar to “4B pencils,” so feminists on Twitter often use pencil emojis or images of 4B pencils as symbols of the movement.


Later, the 4B movement grew into 6B with the addition of 비돕비 (B helps B) and 비소비 (no consumption).

For women who choose not to marry or have children, financial independence and preparation for old age become crucial.

Some women abandon their decision to remain unmarried because they feel unprepared for financial security later in life.

If women are forced into marriage because of financial dependence, they are effectively being enslaved by the patriarchal system.

To escape this system and live as independent individuals who enjoy freedom and human rights, women need a solid economic foundation.

This is where the idea of “no consumption” comes in.


Women earn 30% less than men on average.

They retire earlier than men.

Additionally, due to the pink tax, women face higher costs for everyday products.


Historically, men saved money to buy homes, while women, who were expected to marry and move into their husband’s homes, spent their earnings on cosmetics, clothing, and accessories to conform to societal beauty standards.

However, for women to live as independent citizens free from servitude, they must also save money to buy their own homes and prepare for their futures.

This requires more effort since women earn less than men.


Virginia Woolf once said, “A woman must have money and a room of her own.”

This sentiment aligns with the philosophy of the 6B movement’s focus on 비소비 (no consumption).


It’s not just about cutting back on products subject to the pink tax.

It’s about achieving economic independence and shifting women’s financial habits from consumption-driven patterns to saving, investing, protecting, and growing their wealth.

It is a resistance against “economic sexism,” which creates economic disparities based on gender.


For women choosing not to marry, practicing non-consumption naturally becomes part of their lifestyle.


As I saw translations of the 6B movement being shared, I wanted to add a bit more detail to this specific part.

I’m thrilled to see discussions about the 4B movement happening here on Reddit and to connect with women from other countries.

The 4B movement may lead to significant societal changes, like the declining birth rate in South Korea, but even if such large-scale phenomena don’t occur, I believe it’s valuable for individual women to free themselves from the shackles of patriarchy.

Personally, I’ve come to better understand the enslaving nature of patriarchy through the 4B movement.

Once a woman experiences independence and freedom, it’s hard for her to go back.


I send my support and solidarity to all the women who refuse to fall for society’s propaganda that encourages them to marry, date, and conform to patriarchal norms, and the propaganda that encourages them to consume easily.

Together, let’s carve out our own independent paths.",1731133869.0,,112,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gn40qz/비소비no_consumption/,False

triviamoonlight,t2_cokhfw9u,t3_1gn6kxb,,Tell me I’m not crazy?! WTF,"I (mid-20s) got into a fight with my mom yesterday when the topic of men and marriage came up. We were in the car when she said something along the lines of “all men are pieces of shit” and I agreed and she said “that’s why you need to find an older mature man because men in their 20s and 30s want to play/sleep around and have fun with a bunch of girls and then later when they’re ready they want to settle down with a “good girl”. To which I thought is absolute excuse and bullshit and said “No I’m not accepting used trash that’s been passed around. Every man at their core are horrible and not worth it. I mean in your 50 years of life have you ever met 1 single good man?”. 

Keep in mind my mom has been married and divorced TWICE. Her first husband (my father) physically abused her and beat the hell out of her and promised to one day kill her and did all this even when she was pregnant with my little sister in her tummy. The second husband came over from the Middle east to use my mom’s citizenship in our country and came over and sat on his ass all day in our house doing nothing just using all my mom’s money and resources. 

My mom answered “No I haven’t met a single good man in my life.” and I said EXACTLY and she said “But I have faith they are out there”. Like WTF GIVES YOU THAT FAITH? They are ALL horrible. To which my mom said “So now you recognize men’s game. Now you have to play the game and marry the rich one if they’re all horrible, so even when he turns out abusive or cheating or leaving you can have a ton of money still.” Why do I have to play their game??? Why do I have to risk my life for a chance to have male companionship for the sake of money? I can make my own money and live a peaceful, risk-free life. 

And I’ve been working on starting two businesses of my own - jewelry and pajama wear brands. My mom insulted me and said I’m wasting my time and resources with starting a business rather than trying to move to a country in the middle East to be surrounded by rich men so I can find and pick one from there. But it’s HER dream. She said her dream in her 20s was to move to Dubai and find a rich man and live the luxurious lifestyle but ended up with my abusive abandoning father who left her with 3 daughters to fend for themselves. And that’s why I’m so passionate about 4B. Cuz i grew up seeing only horrible men who will use abuse and leave you and leave his children. Cuz men are selfish. And after all that my mom has been through, I DONT KNOW WHY SHE IS STILL DELUSIONAL and says that it’s bad that I want to end up alone with no man. 

tell me i’m not the crazy one here.  ",1731145014.0,,88,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gn6kxb/tell_me_im_not_crazy_wtf/,False
Flat_Championship501,t2_15cvq5qafe,t3_1gn6r98,,"I am a Korean woman living in South Korea, and I stand in solidarity with all my American and global female comrades participating in the 4B movement!","I joined Reddit specifically to write this post, and as this is my first time posting, I hope you’ll forgive any mistakes I might make due to unfamiliarity with the platform.

Please don’t believe claims that the 4B movement is merely an isolated effort by a small group of femcels online. Even if they don’t actively participate in social movements, young women in South Korea are aware of how disadvantageous dating and marriage can be for women today. Many are choosing to avoid dating and marriage altogether based on this awareness.

The 4B movement wasn’t just devised by a few feminists; by the time it emerged, feminism was already spreading among the general population of Korean women. I have been a staunch feminist since long before the feminist movement gained popularity in Korea, which happened through an online community called Megalia around 2015. I have actively participated and tracked all developments since feminism became a significant movement. From what I remember, the concept of the 4B movement—advocating for no marriage, no childbirth, and later adding principles of no dating and no sex—was first formed around 2016 in an online community called Womad (established after Megalia dissolved and following a trajectory close to Western radical feminism). Although there may be minor errors in timing, it was around that period, and it is accurate to say that Womad was the birthplace of this movement. Claims from the media or some individuals that the 4B movement started in 2019 are incorrect. By then, feminism had spread significantly in Korea, with major anti-spy-cam (hidden camera) protests in Seoul in 2018—wih over 12,000 participants in the first protest, 45,000 in the second, 60,000 in the third, 70,000 in the fourth, 60,000 in the fifth, and 110,000 in the sixth, this was the largest protest in the history of the Korean women’s movement, mobilizing more than 300,000 women in total—and the 4B movement was already a familiar concept among feminists.

As you may know, feminist movements are often omitted from male-dominated historical records, making it easy for them to be forgotten or distorted within a short time.

When the 4B movement was first conceptualized by a small community of about 30,000 members on Womad, no one anticipated that it would receive such extensive coverage in major global media and evolve into an international women’s movement. Sisters, we are making Herstory. There will be predictable backlash from men and from women who oppose us. But let’s not back down. Let’s fight for our rights to the end!

The thing I wanted to contribute is that it is so important, if you’re deciding to be a part of 4B, that you don’t let yourself get sucked in to TERF (trans exclusionary radical feminism) rhetoric that attacks trans women for being ‘inherently violent’. 

I don’t think this is too much of a problem since most of the right wing men that attack women’s rights also hate trans people, but remember - the patriarchy is the core of the problem, the way men are taught from a young age to think women are property or lesser than them. Not an inherent part of a male born person to be violent, or a female born person to submit to violence.

For most people this is probably self explanatory, but I’ve seen it in so many women (including my own mother) who hide behind the defence of ‘women’s rights’ to attack a group of people who make them uncomfortable.

pancake-display,t2_v3kowgph,t3_1gn8a4q,,A reminder about decentering,"So what exactly is decentering? I see many posts here asking ""how do I explain this to my male friends/colleagues/family members?""
You don't. That's the whole point. If you're trying to explain, have revenge, or make men angry, you are once again CENTERING them.

The goal is to act like men are completely irrelevant. You are still doing what you need to do in your daily life, but just not caring about them. Sewer systems exist too, and what do you do about them? Exactly, nothing, because you don't care. They exist, you go about your daily life. You don't go and angrily yell down a drain about how much you just don't care about it. See the difference? It takes some practice because we've been taught that we owe men our attention and smiles, but just pay attention a bit on how you react to everyday situations and you'll get it very quickly. If men try to challenge you or provoke you, do not waste your breath arguing about it - it's what they want, they get pleasure out of seeing women frustrated and sad. You can greyrock or just act confused or whatever you need to do. Then remove yourself from the situation and keep centering yourself

So, what is centering yourself? Think if it this way: what would you do, wear, or act like, if you never had to please another man in ANY way? If you ONLY pleased yourself? If you never had to think ""am I attractive/sexy/kind/empathetic enough""?
What are YOU passionate about doing? Do just that. Enjoy your life. Create friendships with women and flourish. And of course, vote.",1731152413.0,,50,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gn8a4q/a_reminder_about_decentering/,False

Wonderful_Finding384,t2_1cm4umlirw,t3_1gncl7f,,Hi I'm Korean woman! ,"Thanks your attention! I support you 🥰

I use a translator, so it might be awkward. Sorry😁

 Let me introduce you to the 4B movement that started in Korea! And I would like to introduce the comments of Korean women on Naver News.

1. No dating men
2.No sex with man
3.No marriage with men
4.No giving birth

Let me introduce one of the Korean women's comments related to the 4B movement.

I see movement 4B as a very moderate form of quiet resistance rather than radical. There is no real purposeful action, like assaulting or killing men to ensure the most basic human rights, or breaking the gender pay gap and the glass windows of biased corporations. Women who practice 4B simply maintain and enjoy their lives. Not their girlfriend, me, but in three letters of their own name -- not themselves. 
(In Korea, the name is usually three letters)

(Kor/Eng),"First of all, I am a feminist in Korea. (eng is not my first language, forgive me if I have any errors or typos) I recently heard that 4b was spreading since the election, and there are subreddits of 4b. I was so excited.

Really happy to see women of different countries being here and all sharing the same thing. It is a sight for sore eyes.

But anyway, lets get to the important things.



  
You would be thinking like this now. I cut out all males / or can't cut out them now / or is a lesbian but this is not enough. I hate this country, I hate this misogny. Should we do protests? What should we do besides boycotting misogynitic corps? 

What is the core problem anyway?

And how can we solve this?

  
**1. Problem**

In Korea, the mainly believed answer is this:

Many country these days share a simillar phenomenon; men becoming incels by participiating in online communities, but the women becoming feminists.

Women becoming feminist is just normal for a sex who had lost their rights for over thousands of years. We are even very kind for not enslaving men like they did to us.

But why are more and more man becoming increasingly misognists?

Because there are men influencers (example, in Korea's case, PPKga, US's case... Andrew tate and others), youtubers who spread 'red pill' 'alpha male' to other men, and nobody does anything.

Why do they do that? 

Because they get paid. Money. That is the answer. 

Of course, the big answer is the partriarchy, but just saying partriarchy is despicable doesn't change anything. We need to cut their monetization, legal disadvantage them, and raise our voice strong to stop those misognitic men from doing what they do.

Specificly, group up in teams (social media like twitter, other online community, private chatrooms are best) and report their hateful youtube videos so they lose monetization, and report their social media accounts, critize them in groups.

I don't know well about US, but in Korea femicide is so bad that besides protests, we made countless government petitions to call for severe punishment, did 문자총공(texted senators in groups), made 재판방청팀 (applied for trial audiances as teams and watched, pressuring the judge to cut out any misogny), and even made a political party solely dedicated to women's rights called 여성의 당Women's party. 

Seems too much?

The incels are already doing all this. They know a group is more powerful, and if you group up and go to a comment section/online community, you and your group members can fill that section with comments, and make it look like your opinion is the 'right' one. Well, everyone is agreeing, except for a few oddballs. It can't be wrong, can't it?

And to sillence any opposition, they target and harrass women. They can't do anything as a indivisual, so they bond with each other, even foreign incels.

**That is how the misogny became so bad.**

Big online speakers like Tate make normal people into incels, and the incels form into a group and go to comment sections and online communities, terraforming their public opnion into misognitic things by their quantity. And normal persons see that and slowly become incels. 

If women does nothing, this cycle will not stop because men abusing women is a win to so many people in the world that a few professors will say faintly 'this online radical thing is alarming' 'this is weird' but does nothing.

You would think, hey, but there are officials and people in charges, they are sane, this online misogny is a storm in the teacups.

Yeah, but here is a reminder from Korea, who had it sooner.

If you don't stop it now, the incel minded men will grow up and become those officials and people in charges. And then it will be really hard to stop them, women will be fired from jobs because 'ur a feminist u did a hand gesture dont deny it' like we do in Korea right now.

You can still do 4b then, but that is sort of a last plan. You have your chances to make the best scenario.

**YOU CAN BE SILENT OFFLINE, BUT GROUP UP AND SPEAK LOUD ONLINE. ACT TACTICALLY.**

**ONLINE OPINIONS ARE WHAT SHAPE PEOPLE RIGHT NOW.** 

Shoot down the misogny speakers, group up to bash away the incel groups. Men are only perceived to be 'strong' because they learned to act as a group.

In Korea, many women are grouping up, voicing their opinions against misogny in online comment sections (yes, we are fighting whether the officials are incel) and enligntening other women, and it is working well (as you can see)



**2. How to solve this**

to wrap it up, 4b is the bare minimum protest we do (but very effective for it's simplicity) to protect ourselves in this situation.

Because incels won't just cry and run away when we don't talk to them, we need to wipe out the incel infested online points where incels are being made, to avoid their attacks and witch hunts. 

These are things that who are non 4b but want to help can also do it (We will call them the 4b allies)



2-1. Online activity to do 

\-Make women only groups (important) and act online in groups of many number, shaping the incel-swarmed comment sections in a different way (example: if there are 50 incels in a comment section, 50 women go and beat their asses up so that anybody seeing that will not fall into the incel shit) and protecting the women who are being attacked by incels

\-Report youtube (or any social media) incel channels (it is important, because you try to make a Andrew tate comment section clean, it would be impossible. The channel itself needs to go.) as groups, **make platforms stop monetizing them (they do it for the money)**

\-Understand that the 4b is to become yourself in the patriarch world, and enlighten other woman by making contents of 4b (it can be by showing successful, rich women to make the 4b a slay thing to do, or having kids are not so good as the media portrays) so that there will be more to beat the incels ass up 

  
2-2 Politic activity to do

\- I don't know well about US, but doing offline protests, texting senators, attending trials as a group are definitely things that we do here.

\- I heard that the religious people, or the people not geting education are the misognitic ones. Might try making online education courses? I don't know

\- Do not give up your social status, work on your career. When the time goes and incels become officials and they throw fits even more, it is crucial to have women in high positions. Your presence can prevent a witch hunt.

corvidsong,t2_17asw2hxyi,t3_1gnd860,,I want to offer my 5.5 wooded acres for free (to live on) to a few likeminded women ,"I know this is unusual post, but I hope it’s appropriate here and can stay up. 

TL;DR: It’s a very scary time. And it’s going to get worse before it gets better, though I do believe it will get better. I own 5+ acres of beautiful, flat, wooded land in New York State, close to a nice town. It’s perfect for building, growing food, and creating an artistic haven. I’d like to offer it for free use to a few like-minded, practical, and supportive women who share similar values. We could share the land taxes (about $300/year currently), but I’m not looking to profit from this. I’m just in a position to offer a safe space and build community. 


_______ 
I have some empty, raw land (about 5+ acres) in a very beautiful part of New York State. The dream is to eventually have a small cottage, grow food and herbs, have fruit trees, and a big art space where I could do creative work and run my small witchy business. It’s near a really nice (expensive/ educated/ blue) town and there’s a direct train into nyc so it’s not out of the way even though the land itself is heavily wooded and feels very secluded. 99% of the land is completely flat — perfect for building anything on. There’s a tiny hill at the deepest part that’s really adorable and covered in a thick blanket of moss and pine needles. Very cozy. Other than that, it’s flat with 2 very small wet areas (maybe 20’x10’ each) with defined borders (lined by rocks). There are old stone walls around the whole property. I saw wild strawberries last summer. 

I’ve been thinking about offering it for free to build on and live on to a few likeminded ladies who share similar values: did not vote for trump, open minded, lgbtqia friendly, sick of the world but still practical, feminists, supportive, respectful, want to live without men, want to grow things, live from the land. Women who refuse to be mens property but maybe also don’t want to be completely on their own. 

We could collectively pay the land taxes, but I don’t want to charge for this or earn any money from this. It’s just that I own the land and I don’t have the money to build on it yet. It’s sitting unused and honestly I’ve been too overwhelmed and sad lately (my second dad just passed away — the first one two years ago) to start working on it. Otherwise I may sell it next year when my nyc apartment lease is up. 

I know a lot of women are feeling trapped and scared at this time (and honestly anytime) who maybe have the ability, or gumption, or need, or desire to use the land and make something sweet and safe for themselves and a few others. Maybe you’ve been thinking of doing something like this but it’s hard to get started? Or maybe it’s hard to do it alone? Or maybe it’s hard to buy land? I think this would solve all those problems. Women need to stand together and support each other. It might seem a bit crazy, but this is a form of support and community. 

Is this something people would be interested in or is it too big of a jump for people to make? I know some people who would love the idea but would never actually do it. It’s not as though it’s a ready to move in house. How would you go about making something like this happen safely and happily? Ideas? Brainstorm? 

This sub is only a few thousand people, but I thought it would be a safe place to start. 

EDIT: If I think there’s enough interest to really make this work I might start a discord so we can chat. If you’re fairly serious enough to be curious and want to really explore this more just say in the comments or you can dm me and I’ll add you to the list.

Not only that, I also spent money on trendy clothes so that I could blend in with people and society.

After learning about 4B, I started to not wear makeup. The time I used to spend on putting on/removing makeup freed up and I have time to spend on learning new skills, on a hobby, or just to relax. I felt more in control with my time.

Then I also started to wear clothes that are long-lasting and comfortable. I noticed that I started to focus on work and studies much better because nothing was pinching at me or causing me physical discomfort.

That’s when I learned that I’ve been wasting my own money to make myself miserable.

PsychNeurd2,t2_71z46tqu,t3_1gnerpd,,Financially Independent - Here's how I do it,"Hello everyone! I am a financially independent woman in her mid 30's who has savings and doesn’t live with a male partner. I was broke AF until my career started in my late 20s. This originally started as a comment but figured it was enough info to get its own post

I want to tell you about my lifestyle so: 1. You can know it's possible and 2. You can take away ideas for yourself that resonate.

Full disclosure: I now have a high-than-average salary and have a significant of privilege.

  
My lifestyle is such:

* I can afford to live alone but choose to live with a housemates - I like the added safety of not living alone (and I see women in this sub writing that they live alone - don't tell the internet that! That is unsafe!).
* I don't give in to lifestyle creep (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifestyle-creep.asp)
* I mask at work to get ahead. (As I get ahead, I remove blockers for other women. This is part of the fuel for masking so hard)
* Personal life is mostly mask off.
* I buy few clothes which are boring, plain, and not too expensive. Just enough to get me comfortably to wash day and to blend into the background at work and other settings (this makes it easier to avoid male attention). I wear them until they wear out, so I am only replacing, never growing.
* I get my hair cut less frequently into cuts that grow out better
* I think my only hygiene expenditures are like toothpaste, floss, water, soap, oil, shampoo, conditioner. I wait to buy another until the first container runs completely out. I use stuff that works fine and don’t try to play the game of finding “better”. My skin and hair look great. Better than when I used fancy stuff.
* I don't wear makeup, I don't do my hair, I don't buy masks, I don't buy skincare. I don't get botox, lip filler, or unnecessary surgery. I actually don't own or wear any jewelry either (but that's mostly a sensory thing).
* I basically never try to look better or worse than average. Too attractive and I start getting harassed, too sloppy and I start getting dismissed as a human. I never want to play the game of trying to be the hottest woman in the room. I never want other women to feel like they have to ""step it up"" to ""compete"" with me.
* I don't do drugs and I rarely drink - both for finances and for safety
* I somewhat try to minimize utility usage - turn off the heat while I sleep (it's better to sleep cold according to science, anyway), try to use natural lighting from outside during the day, etc. Nothing too extreme, I still want to be mostly comfortable.
* I try not to own multiple of things. I don't need two duvet covers, I don't need 3 pairs of kitchen scissors, I don't need a ton of swim suits, etc.
* I make most of my own meals to ensure it’s made with really good ingredients to protect my health and save healthcare bills in the long run. I cook in bulk so I can easily heat up the food. I also eat time-saving meals sometimes like carrots and shredded chicken dipped in hummus. Easy and somewhat balanced.
* I go to a really cheap gym - again to save money and keep my health (and to to be able to fight if I need to. I lift heavy weights and since the election results came in I started boxing too)
* I don’t try to have new or a lot of stuff - I buy used cars, if I want something I try to find it second hand. If I'm no longer using something, I sell it or give it to someone else who would like it (especially other women, so they don't need to spend money to get the item).
* I try to avoid ""convenience fees"" - For example I'll pick up the food instead of getting door dash (however I used to use these services a LOT when I was disabled)
* I try to do low-cost activities with my friends - make dinner together, go hang out in a park, go to the gym together, etc.
* I allow myself a monthly budgeted amount for hobbies - for me that is sports and nail polish. Both of these things give me great joy.
* I read a lot, so I use the app Libby - free books!!
* I don't partake in social media - I am seeing fewer ads and feel less persuaded to buy things. If I DO see an ad and want something, I ask myself - would I have ""wanted"" this 5 minutes ago? Usually the answer is no and I realize I just don't need it. I spend my ""app time"" watching YT to learn about things, taking free classes to improve my skills at work, checking my banking apps, etc.
* I keep a spreadsheet budget - Once a month I track everything that came in, everything I spent into different categories. If there is any leftover it goes directly into savings. You can also use an app to track this but I prefer having the control of a spreadsheet.
* Even when I was broke AF and could barely afford food in my earlier years, I would still try to put away something like $10/month. Anything that I could spare would go into savings.
* My savings incudes a high-yield savings account, a non-retirement brokerage account, and a retirement account. Savings account is liquid so I can get cash quickly if I need it. Stock account is somewhat liquid depending on the market (I've never had to pull money from it, but I could). My retirement account is a Roth IRA so I could pull money out for medical emergency, buying a house, or paying for school (I think, this is from memory). I never have had to do this and it's a last resort, dire emergencies only. So I basically have 3 layers of fall back money, one of which will hopefully be there when I retire, if I get there.
* I act like the money in all of those account doesn't exist, only focusing on the money in my bank account.
* I have a credit card that I pay off in full every month. I will not buy something unless I already have the money to buy it. I only used a debit card until my very late 20s which really ingrained this habit
* I try my hardest to take on no debt unless ABSOLUTELY necessary. I will save up and buy a cheaper car outright, for example. I have been successfully avoiding debt for years and I don't have school debt (privilege).

Anyway, I'm sure I'm missing some stuff, but this is a lot of what I do. I'd love to hear more suggestions in the comments about what y'all do too and how it's going. Just please BE SAFE when writing about your personal life on the internet in a public sub that's under worldwide scrutiny.",1731172251.0,,115,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gnerpd/financially_independent_heres_how_i_do_it/,False

I would be interested in seeing the dating app stats for Hinge, Bumble, Tinder, and any other dating apps, for user account deletion specifically on U.S. Election Day or throughout that same week.

I would also be interested in long-term follow up stats if there's any significant or notable increase in female account registrations coming back after 6 weeks, 4 momths, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, etc. after any peak number of account deletions.

Let's see how long this holds for and if the recent women (welcome, by the way!) currently with the 4B trend can 'Hold The Line' long-term. ",1731178252.0,,961,0,post,https://i.redd.it/4r3j5wwq9xzd1.jpeg,False
bewildered_Xer,t2_188a2z9wkq,t3_1gnh412,,Let's talk about emotional weight ,"I just read about 4B the other day and am so impressed with the courage expressed here. I'd like to share something, too. It may be relevant and empowering. 

As an adult survivor of childhood trauma I'd been suffering from intrusive thoughts of past abuse. I had no control over my brain and felt re-traumatized by the memories. Then my therapist introduced the concept of emotional weight. They suggested it wasn't the memories re-traumatizing me, but the emotional weight I was giving those memories. With some basic tools, I learned to diminish that emotional weight cognitively and regain control of my thoughts. A year later they're almost completely gone. 

Now apply this concept to 4B. How much emotional weight will we give to the judgement of others? How much to the fear of breaking away from unhealthy relationships, or to living for ourselves and making different choices? We can choose to give little to no emotional weight to fear (not of physical danger, 'cause just run) and make much better choices based on what's truly best for us.

It's just something to think about as we move forward. ",1731178538.0,,39,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gnh412/lets_talk_about_emotional_weight/,False

Liberalism & The Death of Feminism - Catharine MacKinnon 

Sexual Politics - Kate Millett

A Room of One’s Own - Virginia Woolf 

Why Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men - Lundy Bancroft (written by a man but a very good starting place for a lot of women here) 

The Collected Poems - Sylvia Plath 

Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center - bell hooks

And so much more! I will try to put together a Google document at some point. Keep in mind, some of these books & authors are pushing a few subjects. SCUM Manifesto is a notable example of this, being released in 1967 it had huge shock value for its vulgarity and parody of the hate misogynists spew. There is many good things in the book, but take a lot of it with a grain of salt, unfortunately a lot of writings from 2nd wave feminists was rank with bioessentialism. So we need to make sure we are still critical while reading to deconstruct this because transmisogyny is VERY real and we will not leave our trans sisters behind. ❤️

Big-Librarian8435,t2_18cv2lk564,t3_1gnjf3c,,"The reason why incels say women ""expire"" at 25","I am a Korean woman, and I want to share what Korean feminists discuss.

In Korea, there is a term, 상폐녀, which means ""expired women.""

Why do these incels call single women ""expired""? Women never call single, happy men ""expired."" Women are not offended by them.

But these incels are actually scared of single, happy women. They cannot accept the fact that women do not need a man. So they want to spread the idea, ""Single women aren't single by their choice. They are single because they are ugly, fat, and old. They are expired. When they get old, they will regret not getting married and giving birth. They will become crazy cat ladies.""

This way, they think they can manipulate young women into getting married and having children.

There was a popular quote in Korea in 2012: ""A woman's age is like a Christmas cake. After 25, she is expired."" Korean age is different from international age, so 25 in Korea is actually 23 or 24 internationally.

The culture tried to influence young women who had just graduated from university to get married and have children, but the result was the opposite. Young girls who grew up hearing that decided not to date or marry men who treat them like a product that expires at 23. Making extreme misogynistic trends popular only results in more women wanting to stay single.

There are ""passport bros"" who try to find a wife in a developing country. Mail-order bride companies are a big business in Korea because older, poor Korean men living in rural areas often ""order"" wives from developing countries. They are the desperate, unchosen ones, but they call women ""expired.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-48917935

https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/02/asia/foreign-wives-south-korea-intl-hnk-dst/index.html

This is similar to how incels use the term ""sluts"" to insult women. ""Sluts"" refers to women who supposedly sleep with men easily. But this actually applies more to men. When you look at pornography, it is made for men, objectifying women. They spend money on OnlyFans and more. So, how can there be a word to insult only women for being ""easy"" when men are actually easier? Incels create all sorts of terms to insult and generalize women. For instance, they say women are emotional and not reasonable, when most murderers are male.

Birth rates will only decrease if society and people do not treat women as human beings. Especially with the internet, it is now harder to prevent women from coming together to fight back against misogyny.

The time of disgracing women to control them and using them merely as ""babymaker"" slaves will end as more and more people realize it.",1731184841.0,,422,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gnjf3c,False

citizenhoneybee,t2_1cjunlx0zx,t3_1gnkkr9,,Do not despair but also do not derail,"The 4b movement is of great comfort to many women, particularly in the global West, who are waking up from the long, bad dream

And I know many women have been shaking us awake for a while. Sapphic women, WOC, older women, and transwomen have often been the first affected by patriarchy and have often sounded the alarm

There is no woman I would exclude. I do not care if a woman has XX, or not, or trisomy. If she is a woman, she is a woman. There is no gate at the door and no judges either, because this movement has no membership card. Practice it quietly, no matter who you are. You do not need permission.

However, I hope the voices of all women do not derail the practice of 4B away from the 4 actual Bs. Unless they are expanding upon it such as 6B/7B and additions such as 2A and the Ts. Etc

There is room in 4B for dissent and refinement, yes. These things happen naturally as a movement expands. And over time.

But just as there is no membership requirement beyond being a woman, there is also no inherent requirement to do anything beyond basic 4 Bs. No requirement for veganism, no requirement for religion, no even requirement for politics actually if you consider 4B is not always American and what is left and right is different between countries. Politics and culture between South Korea and America (and Europe and Africa and Australia and so on) are as different between them as the needs of millions of women are different.

The only requirements are in the very name. You know what they are. Do not despair, you are welcome here. But also do not derail.

The inheritance of decentering men and living your own life for you, is the inheritance of all women descended from feminism and not patriarchy.

But this windfall does not need to be funneled into all causes on earth because all causes on earth are not women's responsibility. Because it is yours to do with what you wish. That is fine.

Do it.

But recognize the very root of 4b lies in what we do not do. Inaction, here, is a form of action.",1731188064.0,,65,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gnkkr9/do_not_despair_but_also_do_not_derail/,False

But now people on the far right side of the internet are saying that a part of the movement is shaving your head but I’ve never seen anything about this.
As far as I’m aware the 4b movement is no heterosexual marriage,relationships,sex, and no child birth. I have looked everywhere on the internet as to where they got this information but I’ve come up empty handed with a lot of people saying the 4b movement is insensitive to women who are bald not by choice and to women in foreign countries who have it worse and by doing it you’re “playing oppressed”. All of the women I see are not doing it for the movement and are instead doing it to break away from traditional “feminine” traits. I’m not trying to get too political I just think it’s more disrespectful to belittle the affects of the movement for Korean women by calling it “big,bushy,bald,and blaming everyone else” like??? I’ve also seen people refer to it as selfish?? I might be getting carried away so I’ll leave it at that, I’m just confused lol, this is a genuine question tho :)

TerriblePatterns,t2_riud2564t,t3_1gntak5,,Teatime : What are you proud of?,"Grab a cup of teat and let's share stories. I'll go first.

I'm proud of something that happened between today and yesterday.

Yesterday evening I stopped by two random outdoor vending booths where local women were selling their art on vendor tables outside of a bar. As I approached, a guy came to hit on me. I neutrally acknowledged his existence but kept my focus on the art that I was looking at, as well as the questions that I had for the artists. It was difficult because he wouldn't stop talking, pointing out obvious things about the artwork and kept leaning in close to me unprompted. He wouldn't stop talking even though I added nothing to his monologue.

At some point, I paused to look at one particular art piece, and the guy made a comment that he thought that the piece of art was creepy. The art featured the ceramic face of a woman with jewels for tears. I noticed that the artist turned away and pretended to be busy right as he started to say negative things. He personally knew the artist and his comment was overall rude. I ignored it. I went on to contemplate how I felt about the piece without his influence and decided that I liked it. I asked the price, she gave it, he gasped in disbelief, I ignored it. I asked if she had more like it, she said yes, told me more about the piece, what it was used for, and mentioned that she also does commissions. She offered her business card.

####TLDR (though let's be real the tea is good and you read it all)

Today I reached out to initiate a commission from a local artist. I feel good that I'm supporting a local woman's passion for art and that I'll be getting a beautiful piece of art as well.

I also purchased a small print from the other artist. I told her that the image that she drew made me feel happy and she said that she was happy to have brought someone happiness.

My heart feels full remembering these things in this moment. I'm proud of myself. I'm proud of them. I'm proud of all of us.

This new mindset and heartset has given me something beautiful.

midsumernighttts,t2_1ao7kiwk7g,t3_1gnuz70,,men are allowed to be misogynist. women are not allowed to get upset about misogyny.,"i have a lot on my mind and need to rant. i hope i word this right, so here goes... long post incoming 

the biggest thing this election result has taught me is how little men seem to understand why women feel the way we do. i have seen many men say that over the last few years, they have felt vilified, like they're evil. like we have labeled them as something they are not. some are upset about things like us saying all men are trash, or what we chose the bear. one guy even tweeted about the Me Too movement being something that impacted him in a negative way. you know, the movement where women opened up about all the rape and abuse and assault rife in entertainment and sports. i sat there reading that tweet all confused - how could women and girls speaking up about their abuse cause so much distress?

and now i understand. it's us speaking about the misogyny that has angered them. they expect us to shut up. we are not allowed to react to misogyny. we are just allowed to experience it.

they don't like it when we speak up, when we do it with anger. they want the sweet, polite feminist. the one who says ""not at all men"", when almost every rape and sexual assault is committed by men. 

all i can think is - if words on the internet upset you this much, how would you handle being a woman? imagine being a woman and knowing that your sisters all over the world - from the dawn of time - have been raped and tortured and abused and assaulted and killed by men? imagine having men make rape ""jokes"" to you and about you, tell you you're nothing but a hole, tell you that you deserve whatever assault happened to you, call you a slut and a whore for having sex when often all they want from you is sex. slut, whore, cunt, bitch. hateful words invented just for us.

but now they feel lonely and sad :( they're bewildered! ""why won't women date me??"" they're all on their own, they have no one. how come men are allowed to feel lost and lonely, like they have no sense of belonging? what about women? do they wonder how we feel knowing that they love and support and adore guys like Andrew Tate? men who advocate for rape? do they wonder how lonely and scared that makes us feel??? no, we just have to suck it up. but can we talk about it? noooooo they get so sad :-( poor lil babies can't handle a simple sentence: ""all men are trash"", ""i choose the bear"". just think if they had to deal with what we have to deal with. they wouldn't last a day

so why the hell are they shocked by us wanting nothing to do with them??? years and years and years of violence, of abuse, of rape, of pedophilia, of murder, of rape, of control. it's pure hatred of women and girls. they hate us and like to hurt us but still want us to love them. did they really think women wouldn't absorb the hatred they feel for us? do they think that blatant misogyny would have no consequences?

you cannot abuse the other half of the population for literally centuries and expect that other half to take it forever. were they really not expecting women to get tired of their shit? apparently so. looks like they were wrong.",1731222146.0,,638,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gnuz70/men_are_allowed_to_be_misogynist_women_are_not/,False

V-RONIN,t2_4pdspfxe,t3_1gnz6i2,,Just wanted to repost a comment I made. Follow Lilith. ,"I highly recommend the book Lilith by Nikki Marmery.  It is a good fictional story about Lilith and how she helped women on the sidelines. And how she saw first hand the rise of mysongnistic beliefs in Christianity. I highly recommend it. 

Right before I was going to move into my first apartment I was slowly preparing myself to try to get back into dating maybe do some therapy to get over past abuse and distrust towards men. Roe fell two months before my move in date. 

When Harris was running I knew the statistics of there being more women voters, more educated women more women that owned homes. I was naive. Even though I studied history for fun and could see the patterns. I was still naieve. 

Then Trump became president. 

And my door for romance was not only closed but nuked. 

I have no more faith in having a relationship with the sex im attracted too. And that part hurts. 

I'm ok with being by myself I'm a introvert anyways. But I have to do what I have to do to protect myself.

I watched my mom rely on men my entire life. And I saw what happens to a woman who is financially dependent on men. And I never wanted to be that.

So when I finally get a new apartment, a promotion etc. I get told by my own stupid Christian brain washed country that I'm actually a second class citizen.

I'm joining the 4B movement officially. It makes sense now with the blatant rise of mysongnistic attitudes across the globe. Men only want sex and free labor. They are only allowed to show emotions if its anger. Happiness and status equals just using warm bodies as trophies and fleshlights.

There is a reason why they took Lilth and Asherah out of the Bible. Woman have been serving men for thousands of years. And what fucking breaks my heart is we only got about 2 to 3 generations of freedom before it was taken from us. 

All because of lazy power hungry assholes that only get hard if they are hurting and putting down others. 

Men can complain about the system they created now all they want im not listening. Im going to go down the road Lilth did and fuck off into the sunset because I refuse to be submissive to a man.

bewildered_Xer,t2_188a2z9wkq,t3_1gnzhn3,,Men seem confused about our anger. Let me explain it.,"My first memories from childhood are of violence against me. I grew up in a dangerous toxic household ruled by a violent toxic male. I never had the luxury of not knowing **our culture is built on the subjugation of women. Why, though? I see one glaring cause; free/cheap labor**. Labor in the home, labor in the workforce, emotional labor, physical labor, you name, we've been buried under it. 

**Culturally, we've been tasked with too much work**; taking care of the house, taking care of the kids, taking care of the bills, being responsible for the emotional wellness of everyone in the family, including hubby/partner/significant other, organizing the lives of family members, loving and supporting everyone in our sphere, and doing it all with acceptance and a smile. 

**Women of different socioeconomic levels feel these demands to varying degrees**. The higher the household income, the more labor/responsibility can be dispersed to others; cleaners, nannies, tutors, kids activities. As you go down the income scale, our work is increasingly piled onto the woman. I think that's why there's a split with women and their views. If a woman is better off, the system works better for her and she sees no reason for the fuss. If a woman is less advantaged, the system isn't working so well for her, and her physical, emotional, and psychological health is at risk. However, make no mistake, we all pay a price.

**Now that we have a disenfranchised group of people without the same privileges/expectations in life, it's easy to dismiss their complaints.** Gas lighting, rationalizing, minimizing all play a part in keeping the system in tact. When that falters and women increasingly work for change, violence is used to keep them silent and duty-bound. It's my personal belief that's why Roe was overturned. There's no more effective way to keep women tied down than to remove the ability to choose when to have children.  

That's why I personally checked out of this twisted system more than a decade ago. Yes, I married, and yes, I do have a daughter. I also realized I was living a no win life. I love my daughter deeply, and I credit her with helping me through the worst of healing from my horrific childhood. But, had I the opportunity to do things over, I would live a 4B life from birth to death. This lifestyle isn't about revenge, a shout for help, or recognition. It's about removing oneself from a damaging lifestyle built on the exploitation of women. **We don't have to make a grand stand. We just have to be true to ourselves and not participate**.  

This is my personal take on what's happening and why. I have nothing but love and admiration for women who, like me, have decided to put the exploitation behind them.

DarkLuxeCreatrix-717,t2_16uywwdp34,t3_1go1n36,,"#DeleteYourDatingApp is working (women going 4B and deleting Bumble, Hinge, and Tinder after the U.S. Presidential Election)","After my first post about women deleting their Tinder accounts after the U.S Presidential Election (Tuesday, November 5, 2024), a number of comment section respondents mentioned the idea of a pro-4B mass dating app deletion campaign. 

Women have already been doing this individually without any strategic coordinated effort but *what do you all think about an attempt to ramp that idea up tactically and with mass collective intention?*

Here are some censored (for some privacy) colored-over drawn-over screenshots from different group comment sections where women are sharing deleting or editing their Hinge, Bumble, and Tinder profiles.

Some women aren't permadeleting and are instead putting the 4B symbol 🐝🐝🐝🐝 in their dating profile bios or social media bios. Or putting a ""🐈🐻"" symbol to show they ""choose being a single childfree cat lady"" and ""choose the bear"" over men instead.

However, *permanently deleting the dating app entirely** is what **has a real impact** on dating app data and user statistics.

Some guys are already reporting a drop in matches and hook-ups since U.S. Election Day.

Some women plan to practice 4B for the next 4 years only. Others plan to push beyond that. 

I am fascinated by the range and variety of takes and interpretations on practicing 4B, whether short-term or long-term. 

I saw one woman's comment where she said she'll be practicing 4B until misogyny doesn't exist anymore.

There are also private 4B Movement Facebook groups interested women can join. I am not in that one yet but there are different options for organizing, collaborating, mobilizing, coordinating, and supporting each other in the 4B (having no sex, having no children, no dating men, no marriage) journey. 

I support some of the different takes and recognize there will always eventually be some range and variation in movements as different people take it on, as long as the core tenets are acknowledged and female allies who are pro-4B but aren't actively practicing it understand that.

E.g.: some women in the comments say they support 4B in theory and support 4BWomen who are practicing but they cannot because they're already in relationships or marriages with men but again, they actively support in other ways, such as Bee4Bee (B4B) which is support, solidarity, and networking amongst women for the movement.

We'll see how this all plays out in both the short-term and long-term.

filtered_shadows,t2_4slsadf5,t3_1go36yp,,conservatives incentivize businesses to stimulate the economy. where are the policies to incentivize women to engage with men/sex/marriage/pregnancy?,"
from an economic perspective, conservative voters praise deregulation, keeping business taxes low, providing high supply of goods, and a free market, because all of this helps businesses make more money - which they believe will *incentivize* businesses to hire more employees and stimulate the economy. (whether that actually ends up happening isn’t my point, it’s that they are banking on getting enough factors in place to incentivize the outcome they want.)

instead of *incentivizing* women to get pregnant and reproduce (by providing safe and affordable reproductive healthcare, lowering the financial burden of childcare, keeping protections in place to ensure women can get out of unsafe marriages, etc.), conservatives have voted in a party to remove rights, freedoms, and choice, and increasing the danger for women in all of these areas. instead of incentivizing people to do what they want them to do, their plan is to force people to do what they want by removing options…?

I work out as much as the boys do (the oldest niece joins me sometimes and it's super cute). I don't talk about boys, I talk about my job. I talk about making art and hiking. I want to make sure that these girls know there isn't just one way to be a girl. That what the world is selling them as ""what a woman should do"" isn't what they have to do. And I know that if you are involved in 4B, there's a lot of conservatives saying ""good"" because in their minds we're doing what they think we should be. But actually, this would only be true if we were sitting around bemoaning our lack of a traditional marriage all the time rather than living our lives. Remember that you can defy them by simply being yourself. Your existence can run counter to their narrow minded worldview and just by living differently you can show younger girls a different path.

paperazzi,t2_z6vuo,t3_1go3vxe,,Older women and 4B,"It is pretty common for older women, divorced or widowed, to remove themselves voluntarily from the dating pool.  They do this for the peace of mind and freedom from the duties expected of them by a dwindling supply of decent older men.  Society has generally mocked and ridiculed them (cat lady jokes, Karen memes) or, worse, tries to set them up with a man because being an unattached, independent woman is a threat to the societal order.  

Younger women seem to have caught on to just how much more wonderful life actually is without the expectations of having sex when you don't want to, doing the emotional heavy lifting, having pain and needs dismissed, being patronized, ignored, talked down to, having to clean up after, plan for, schedule for the needs of a man, fearing violence, etc, in exchange for....what?  Just what is she getting out of her relationship with a man, anyway?  What does he offer?  Most men aren't protectors.  They'd just as soon turn and run to save himself  if their female partner was in danger.  Women make their own money and, despite  the stereotype, there are far more male gold diggers out there ready to help themselves to her pocketbook than there are women after men's money.  Most men are more akin to leeches or parasites than actual partners in every way.

I'm glad more younger women are beginning to really value their own peace of mind, recognize their self worth and saying enough is enough.  Together, we are strong.

**PLEASE FOCUS ON UNITING AND NOT DIVIDING RIGHT NOW!**

Consider the following:

* Men are **actively infiltrating our online spaces** to propagate narratives that will inflame us, suspect one another, and turn on each other 
* They are **ACTIVELY spreading false rhetoric** about what 4B means, our core beliefs, who we allow into this movement, etc. 
* They are **posing as women** and trying to get us to engage in these arguments 

# THIS IS A COMMON WAR TACTIC THAT'S USED TO MAKE US TURN ON EACH OTHER FROM THE INSIDE. DON'T FALL FOR IT. 

**Do** your own research.

**Do** understand that we can have differing opinions about feminism but the most important actions we need to take right now are to STAND TOGETHER. This is what MEN are doing, and they know it makes their causes stronger. There is strength in numbers. 

**Don't** spread hate or division to other women who are still on their path of waking up. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT MEN WANT! 

Regardless of what you believe or how you are enacting change, ANY CHANGE IS PROGRESS right now. 

**We need to stand together right now and focus on what unites us, not the things that divide us.**  From a logical perspective, this movement needs to start with uplifting ALL WOMEN so we have the power, autonomy, and energy to fight other social battles. 

Just be careful what you consume, check your sources, and kindly correct other women who are spreading misinformation (if you so feel called, but also - protect your peace if you don't feel called - that's the beauty of this movement).

It's a movement that's supposed to be about recentering ourselves and our relationships with other women, and they just focus on the no sex part. It's kinda funny, in an infuriating way, how their eyes glaze over everything else as they snicker and laugh. Like the only part that matters to them is sex. They don't care about no relationships, no marriage, no kids: bet they never cared about those in the first place, and it's societal conventions and the cementing their place as a man that drive them to those other levels.

Men don't bother to understand. They don't bother to empathize when they can ridicule instead. Their issues matter, but when women have a very real concern- when we're dying cause religion is interjected into politics- men, regardless of liberal or conservative ideology, can't seem to understand. They don't get where our fears are coming from. They don't understand that 4b isn't even about men. That not everything has to be about them.

And *I* don't understand them, anymore, cause if they can't grasp something that feels so simple, so instinctual and terrifying and all-consuming for me, than there's nothing that I can trust them to understand.

And maybe I could pound this into their heads... But, I feel as if it'd be equivalent to helping a stubborn child with their homework.

palmreeschillin,t2_n1rg8nq,t3_1goctbw,,Ideas on how to de-center men and the patriarchy from your life,"Often times when I’ve thought about de-centering men or not having a partner, I feel panic, because I feel like I need that companionship. And of course, I want it, I want someone to love me. I feel like there’s a dark empty hole in my body with the initial shock. I’ve often gotten and given advice to fellow women that they should focus on other things and ourselves, but maybe it would be helpful to share a list of things and ideas that help de-center men and what we mean when we give advice to ""focus on yourself"".

For me personally, I love to spend time and focus on:

**Yoga! -** I fucking love yoga. I’m not advanced at all, I can’t even touch my toes yet, but I love being able to really feel in control of my body and get more and more in tune with myself. The way I feel in my body and mind after, it’s magical. I try to do this at least once a day or as much as I can get it in.

**Podcasts** \- When I'm feeling really overwhelmed and drained, sometimes just putting on a podcast and relaxing or doing something like cleaning while listening helps ground me. I like true crime, history, comedy, and I want to explore different genres as well.

**Read/Watch Videos on how to deal with narcissists** \- Watching videos on the tactics of narcissists, how to deal with them, how to protect yourself with them, etc all help me feel soo much better when I feel that pit of despair. It helps remind me of how I should be treated and helps me feel secure that I'm doing the right thing, ironically not just for me, but for them and the rest of the world. Us not tolerating abuse helps everyone. These videos will give you the power of knowledge and the tools to protect yourself and navigate life with these people all around. I also recommend reading books on this, one that is a must is ""Why Does He Do That"". There are free pdfs if you search (and you can DM me if you need the link as well)

**Read/watch videos on self-improvement** \- The patriarchy has drained us and taught us how to socialize in ways that are most beneficial to men in power. Finding different ways to open your mind, rework old habits, think differently about things, treat people more genuinely, etc are all things that can fill your time and improve your relationship with yourself, loved ones, and the world.

**Games!** \- I love games, I don't play them enough but just the thought of being able to get all my work done so I can cozy up to a game makes me feel 100% less alone funny enough and motivates me to take care of things. I love playing Sims, my switch, and I would love to get into some games that I can play online with women friends (if you have any recs or would like to play together, DM me and let's make it happen!!)

**Getting my shit together** \- Yesterday I busted my ass to clean up and organize my space, and now it's soo cozy and relaxing. It's clean, organized, peaceful, and smells like a damn spa. I worked on getting my insurance sorted, am planning to schedule any doctor visits and dentist appointments I need. I'm in the works of getting my finances planned and budgeted, all things that help keep me independent and healthy. Anything that I need to do, whether make sure my car is 100% good, resources are secure, finances are sorted, health is good, etc. Whatever you need to do, get it done now, especially before Trump takes office (if you're in US, but even if you're not better to do things asap, who knows what will happen and you will have more freedom when you are secure, safe, and healthy as best you can be). Do the best you can with where you're at to be the best you can for yourself and the world around you.

And last but not least, **Friends and other healthy social outlets**!! Reaching out to friends consistently, making new friends, joining and participating in healthy groups and communities, listening and being there for women, all are ways to fill our time, hearts, and give us fulfillment in life. When disconnecting from unhealthy men and women attached to the patriarchy, we need to find social outlets and community elsewhere. Now is NOT the time to isolate. If you can't find anyone, BE that person. Be a kind, loving, thoughtful person. Learn how to calm down your nervous system, have an open and loving mind, and consistently keep in touch with those who need you and those who you need. Make groups. Make group chats, create game nights, make it a habit to remember to keep in touch and be a good friend.

These are some things that I do to refocus my time and energy. When I focus on these things, I feel so much better. I feel way more fulfilled any happy than any of the years I've been with a man or years I've spent trying to make other people happy when I've been drowning in misery from their treatment of me. These are things that work with me and my personality and I can't wait to try some new things as well. Now that you're getting rid of the huge burden men, sexist media, complicit women, and in general the patriarchy put on you, this is the time to grow and bloom. Try to find things that work with your life as it is right now, and maybe try to expand on some new things if you're feeling up to it!

Some other recs just to give you quick ideas:

* Running
* Writing
* Puzzles
* Activism (look at you already on top of this one ;)
* Cooking
* Home Improvement
* New hobbies and hobby groups

When you need ideas, I love to look up recommendations from people trying to break digital addictions. It sounds odd, but they give great and vast recommendations to fill your life when you have a giant hole in it (them cutting out/limiting technology, us, men and the patriarchy!)

Many here have also recently made great points about paying attention to where you give you time, energy, and resources. Trying to avoid things where you are the product, where you are being exploited or have to spend a lot of money on, media that is sexist, etc are all ways you can help end the patriarchy. Being mindful of where you're giving your time, energy, resources, and your precious life on earth!!

If I were to make recommendations, I would say pick one thing to actively start working on physically (hiking, walking, dance, etc), mentally (reading, meditation, drawing) and socially (friends, community groups), but truthfully, this is your time to decide what you would like to do with your life. You are smart, capable, and powerful. I have faith that you will create a beautiful life for yourself and I hope you post plenty about it so that we can not only support you, but be inspired by it as well!

I hope this helps some people who are unsure on how to stabilize their life and what to do next. If you already are doing this and or want to share some ideas, please do!

calmingstar,t2_qwd2a,t3_1god1yi,,Don't let them see it coming,"Reading about the 4B movement in Korea, it has inflicted more damage on the patriarchy in less than 10 years than all the marches, hashtags and pink hats of the last 50 years. Why? Because the women of Korea are doing it quietly, on the sly. I've just seen a Korean claiming that the movement means nothing, and all his female family members want to find a husband. The unintended subtext here is that they are not married despite their outwardly expressed eagerness.

That's not how Western feminists are used to operating, being loud and proud. But the 'loud and proud' part makes us vulnerable to all kinds of astroturfing and smear campaigns, that could seriously damage the movement even before it properly takes root.

So, if we want it to succeed, we need to go into the underground mode. Adhere to the principles quietly. Slogans, t-shirts, bracelets, hashtags, secret signs, campaigns - none of it does anything other than putting a target on our backs and causing counter-propaganda go into an overdrive. 

Do it quietly, spread it person to person. Let them think that it has fizzled out, while it's bubbling right under their feet.

Just_Revolution_1206,t2_1cpzc24vu3,t3_1gojgdg,,Long-time 4B feminist from East Asia AMA,"Hello sisters! I’m a first-gen East Asian immigrant living in the states. Having been part of this movement for years, I'm thrilled to see how it's spreading in the West but also disappointed with Western media's misinterpretation.

The way they see it as a sex strike is blatantly misogynistic. They are not even hiding it anymore that heterosexual sex in patriarchy is unequal, exploitative and is a kind of slave labor. Women who choose abstinence are seen as the same as suppressed laborers appealing to their boss. Probably some of the American women who only recently started to identify as 4B do consider it a sex strike and a leverage to bargain with men, which is certainly better than compliance and submission. But that's not how we started it in East Asia and definitely not the gist of this movement. 

That’s why I want to share some of my opinions and also provide some experience, strength and hope in case sisters here have any questions.

The first thing I want to clarify is that we do not practice 4B/7B4T as a temporary tactic to bargain with men. We see it as a life-long commitment.

We do not wish to change men for the better. It's good if they decide to redeem themselves, but that's not our job. Chronically focusing on changing people other than yourself is the definition of codependency. We strive to pay undivided attention to ourselves and women as a group. Talking about men, even criticizing them, is providing emotional labor to them as they thrive in all kinds of attention from women.

Furthermore, our vision is not to create a world where men can treat women well. We want to treat ourselves well and have the power and resources to do it. We achieve this by giving all of our time, energy, resources to ourselves and like-minded women in need. By refusing to be blood bags for men and patriarchal family, we find unlimited prosperity in our lives even if we come from very modest backgrounds.

Another question worth addressing is “Is 7B4T about hating men”? The answer is “Yes and no”. Some of us did come from a place of vehement hatred against patriarchy and men due to our past traumatic experience. But hate is seldom sustainable and in the long term only consumes its owner. Throughout the years, I have seen this pattern in my fellow 7B4T sisters that the longer we've been practicing this lifestyle, the less resentment we have. It's not that we've become numb to the vice of patriarchy. We just heal, let go, and don't give a damn any more. We no longer react to triggers, we promptly act to make a difference. Again, this movement is about absolute, radical self love as women. The ones who are furious, hyper-aggressive but fail to cultivate consistent self-love as feminists in the meantime are actually more likely to go back to the traditional lifestyle when the passion fades. If you are all about hating men, you'll not go far in this journey. In long term, this movement is more about establishing than destroying.

That being said, I have no judgment for women who are interested in 4B but, for various reasons, not there yet. Feminism is a spectrum and 7B4T is what I consider to be the best version of our time. It’s always better to make small progress than staying where you were placed by this society. It’s a life-long learning and unlearning process and we all have our own pace. And I wish every woman can do her best.

BriefPeak7196,t2_vhd9xgft,t3_1gomspn,,Woman of the Hour ,"Woman of the Hour 

Long post here! 

This movie captures misogyny so well. It’s set in the 70’s but is still relevant today, showcasing a lack of growth in the opposite sex. I observed a couple different things and want to jam it out. 

First and foremost if you aren’t comfortable with watching violence towards women right now, I understand you and I’m sorry you’re feeling that way. I feel it a bit too and am looking away when I need to and finding comfort in other movies such as House Bunny, Easy A, 22 Jump Street etc. Self-care is pivotal right now, and I see you. 

The first scene is a little jarring and we end up meeting our main character Sheryl who is immediately facing objectification in an audition. She lives in LA and has seemingly one friend, Terry. *said with disdain* Terry is another classic dude who makes a pass at Cheryl when she’s seeking a friend and in vulnerable place and SHE APOLOGIZES TO HIM. She ends up in his bed exasperated with all the circumstances (no shame, game recognizes game) of her job of trying to be an actress and the men around her and ends up taking a gig for a dating show. At this point, I can’t help but wonder if it’s inferred that she felt like she had to sleep with Terry and I find that a small think piece. 

Cut to we as the ‘real audience’ see a flashback of two victims. One moving into her apartment and one a young runaway. I want to try to pay attention to the victims, I don’t remember names that well. I apologize. I feel like mainstream media tends to focus on the people who commit these crimes more than the people who suffer them so I’m going to try to not do that. 

The side plots come in other characters such as Laura and Mario. Mario works with the thug (i’m going to call him this from here on out because murderer feels too gaunt) and is seemingly a gay man. Laura is an audience member of the dating show and she is immediately triggered upon seeing the face of the thug in Bachelor #3. She ends up running out of the studio knocking over film equipment that forces the show to be put on pause. Getting back to her car (nothing hits like a cigarette in these times) her bf comes to sit with her and gaslights tf out of her. He’s lit with good intention but doesn’t want to make waves and that fear of falsely accusing another man of a crime is what rules him. Thank Fuk she tells him to get out. Because he did everything and was seemingly gentle and pulled the i love you but “what more can i do” and it’s this subtle stuff I think we need to be talking about. Cheers for another think piece! 

Getting back to the show Cheryl steps her game up at the advice of her makeup artist which is what I see feminist support being all about. She was so uncomfortable and out of her element just putting on a face to appease the men in power of this show and it wasn’t believable. She rewrites her questions and even in the opening sequence we see a spark, a smirk of protest and wit! It feels real! Credit is due to both women in that moment. One for the makeup artist to empower Cheryl to say whatever she wants and not be the bimbo they want her to be. Two for Cheryl herself who switched up and asked thought provoking questions that are funny and charismatic. It showcased intelligence and complexity. I find that really poetic and empowering in watching it and wonder about the juxtaposition of how women have depth and men think they are superficial (among other things). I observe that difference in men viewing everything as a competition and women aren’t allowed to have a reaction. I could go on with the examples and comparisons (esp as a psych student grad in may) but I’ll save it. 

How embarrassing to not understand intellectual thought lmaooo bachelor #1 just flops. Bachelor #2 is already threatened by the thug and thinks with his johnson so we’re gonna call him Johnson. And there it is, the thug doing what thugs do. In the way of a psychopath he is calm, cool and collected. He gets away with playing a game that is somehow just honest enough that it’s charming. Without answering the question he still makes a statement and it’s what some would call disarming. He shows his intelligence in a way where he’s not barking, biting, or showing red flags. Dangerous behavior is all encompassing and it doesn’t look any one specific way. Especially this kind of person, more specifically this kind of man. It’s not always easy to see the red flags and that’s why it’s increasingly hard to leave abuse. There’s so many ways that one person can gain control over another person and a lot of the time it does start like this in “nice guy” ways. That’s so scary if you zoom out and think too long on it. 

From here on out flops and johnson are just a spluttering mess of misogyny and it’s entertaining yet also begs the question of something to the affect of how do we hold men accountable especially when it comes to things like comedic value. I loved the discourse of matt rife (try guy i want to call him) and it seemed we understood the assignment when that happened, so what happened in the election? It seems as if there’s quite a bit of women doing what Cheryl did in the beginning of the movie, and is that out of fear? Conscious or unconscious? Maybe i’m even looking for confirmation bias, i’ll never tell. xoxo gossip girl. 

Finally getting back to Laura, we see her going to security for the show and it feels like a small flash of “yes, please, get him” in a way that kind of also makes you feel a small bit of worry that she won’t truly be believed. 

The thug then puts Johnson on blast and I want to address this too. I have seen (and experienced) men giving a “compliment” in the form of putting another one down while trying to lift you up. Don’t fall for it. I also want to take note of how he was “honest” once again in what feels like telling on johnson for his behavior backstage. 

The makeup artist is a GD queen. She gives the perspective of “Which one of them will hurt me?” to Cheryl that you can see is a great consideration and she needed to hear it. 

“You and me, we’re gonna have words” okay Johnson lmaoooo. I think this sidebar convo is pretty real. Not that I would know but the way that men are in competition to one another and ruled by their ego and emotion it seems pretty to the point. The 70’s woodchucks drive this. 

Cheryl ends up picking the thug which almost seems fated in a weird way. It was like the thug’s words were velvet and the game was a seamstress, she didn’t need that textile, but she wanted it. In meeting the bach boyz johnson warns Cheryl of the thug and it gives her pause. Which made me pause because are you warning her because he told on you or are you really warning her for reels this time. After the boys had words the thug showed johnson a violent polaroid picture of a woman and says it was fake. Seeing that is believing that and there’s so much to be said for this but mostly that men will act different around everyone especially women and these are all little red flags that can easily be missed. 

Immediately the thug is handsy yet still somehow gentle and I’m gonna need this to wrap up lmao. Panning back to Laura, the intuition was right. She ends up waisting her time and waiting for no one but the janitor which is low key angering in itself. She’s triggered, feeling grief and panic and maybe just needs to call or drive to the police station at that point? Make them turn it on and come GET HIS ASS. idk what would you do in that situation? 

The rest of the movie is a visual reenactment of the thug’s crimes and him just continuing to escalate and portray a calm confident person. He’s not though and the psychopathic personality  will always have this sick underbelly that lies in wait like a predator. 

His MO was the same, get women alone or drive them out to a secluded area of the mountains and take their picture. Cheryl and the thug end up on an actual date and while watching it i’m just unsettled. I know what she doesn’t and the thug probably loves that meanwhile I’m like “girl”. He does let the mask slip though in a small way where he withdraws and slams his cup down and questions Cheryl for going on to the dating show. “Did you feel seen?”. Makes me cringe because I know that she was seen by the makeup artist. That didn’t come from him or from a man (derogatory). The makeup artist was her true ally who saw her for a human and another woman who wasn’t being herself. She saw Cheryl as someone that needed a little inspiration and permission to buck back at the treatment they both face and know is there. I hate to call that validation and want to talk about it more like inspiration coming from another. No matter what a man says or how he tells you to show up, YOU have the power to not do that and YOU have the power to help instill that in other women. That feels like feminism. It feels like integrity and honoring yourself. You don’t need permission and you don’t need someone else to do it for you. 

Cheryl ends up seeing the thugs true villainous side. Laura ends up showing what it’s like to not only be a woman and not be listened to but to be a Black woman in the 70’s and not be listened to and it’s so frustrating to watch. I’m a white woman and everyday I try to be heard and seen and the experience is ass. I cannot imagine what it is like to be a woman identifying person of color. 

One of the victims is able to survive by truly acting and playing the part of a sort of girlfriend to the thug. She’s able to make a break for it given the opportunity of him using a rest stop bathroom. If you see your out, take it. Run and fight like hell. Scream, kick and claw. DNA will get under your fingernails. Take pictures and document everything. Talk about it and stand your ground. 

The end is presented with facts about the thug. He was reported for over a decade by survivors and others without repercussions. He was released on bail and killed two more women. He was eventually convicted of seven women and girls. Authorities estimate victims to be 130. His runaway survival victim testified in court against him and he died in prison. This is not only a testimony to how the systems themselves are oppressive to victims and women-identifying people but that you can stand up for yourself and still win. It’s bittersweet but we can. And we will. Together and individually.

galaxynephilim,t2_5ur2xuez,t3_1gomybp,,I wish men could/had to relate (Looking for analogies),"They see sex so differently than us. The fact they can act so entitled to it shows unreal levels of narcissism/psychopathy it's horrifying. Their baseline ""normal"" way of relating to women is straight up psychopathic. Men are literally taught by their fathers and peers that the correct way to relate to girls/women is through manipulation and deceit and inauthenticity. And so much more that gets way more horrible, which they've just normalized. Men should be mad at their male ""role models"" and society/patriarchy for lying to them and completely fucking up their relationships with themselves and with women. 

I don;'t think anything is wrong inherently with male sexuality but the monster that it has turned it into is not what it is, or what it is supposed to be. Yet most believe it is and have decided to normalize it. 

It's crazy how so many men are crying misandry when their own beliefs are that they are just sociopaths and pigs by nature who don't know better, have to objectify women, can't be responsible, can't empathize or communicate or understand emotions, etc. They are projecting their own self-hatred onto women in a never-ending cycle..... a cycle that only they can break, which they attempt to make us responsible for breaking as a covert way of actually keeping it going because they apparently seem to think it somehow is or is going to benefit them.

***I have heard the unsafety that women feel being put like this: imagine as a man if you were in prison and had all the other male prisoners who are stronger than you, wanting to F your A and feeling entitled to you and like they own you. In that scenario maybe men could understand how women feel unsafe, like prey, like objects.*** 

***This doesn't account for the pregnancy risk aspect or countless other things. I'd love to know if y'all can come up with more analogies designed to make men relate to more aspects of all this that we experience.*** ",1731310795.0,,61,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gomybp/i_wish_men_couldhad_to_relate_looking_for/,False

glowfawn,t2_6hygrdrny,t3_1gooa0b,,"Move in silence, do not broadcast or wear merch, it’ll put a target on your back ","I came across [this post on the twoxchromosomes subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/s/6AYdKI83hD) and I hope it is okay to link it here, mods. It explains how 4B operates in SK and is a reply to those that keep saying that 4B is virtually unknown in SK and that nobody there follows it. Well guess what, women who follow 4B will never bring it up if asked. And I believe with the strange amount of pushback 4B is getting within the US and other Western countries after just one week(!), 4B outside of SK should do the same. Move in silence ladies. 🤫

Maybe it’s a more western thing, maybe the pushback here hasn’t been strong enough yet, but I’ve seen people wanting to make and wear 4B T-shirts, bracelets and other merch. Women were posting themselves shaving their heads, videos that went viral and are now all over the news. I’ve also seen women claiming to be 4B engaging in long and drawn out arguments with trolls and male rage baiters. Women are deleting their dating apps, but not without explicitly sending the developers messages that they were doing so because of 4B. I know this is coming from a good place, there is energy and drive behind it, but please try to refrain from doing these things. Wearing merch or specific colors, hairstyles etc… directly puts a target on your back and you never know how far deranged people will take it. 4B is the most effective when you don't bring it up, because then even those who can’t afford to openly show their alliance can quietly partake. The point is disengaging and decentering from men, not making it your personality, drawing attention to the individual or sacrificing yourself for a cause. There is no need to prove yourself for 4B, the rules are simple and you need virtually nothing to make that lifestyle switch. You don’t have to justify, explain or announce yourself. If 4B is something you want to participate in, just follow the rules and go about your life.

Many women have already been doing 4B without even knowing there was a name for it, just out of personal choice and self-preservation.

Curvy-Insect,t2_miupd7c5,t3_1gostua,,"Movie ""Des Teufels Bad"" ","Just watched this movie. It is supposed to be an horror movie and in fact it ends up being horror but not the kind you expect. It is social horror, it depicts how it is like to live in an heavily patriarchal society where women have no freedom and religious institutions have the power. 

It is based on historical research made on the phenomena called suicide by proxy. Basically in the 17th and 18th centuries suicide was considered a sin worst than murder because since you could not confess before dying your soul would be lost forever. However if you committed murder you'd be sentenced to death but you could confess to a priest which would absolve your sins and you would go to heaven. So people who were unhappy and wanted to die would commit a murder and hand themselves in to authorities to be sentenced to death. 

There are 400 reported instances of this in German speaking areas of Europe. Most were women and they committed the murder against children. 

If you watch the movie you will understand why. The main character was such a happy young girl with hobbies (collecting insects) until she got married. She prayed for a child but her husband was gay and didn't touch her so obviously she didn't get pregnant. That made her depressed especially because to everyone, particularly her MIL said it was her fault that she couldn't please her husband and bear a child. The MIL also shamed her for not doing the tasks she was expected to.

 At one point she made a female friend and the MIL told her to stay away from her. The husband threw her insects in the fire. So basically they smashed anything that could bring her joy and completely isolated her until she became heavily depressed and wanted to die. 

Des Teufels Bad means Devil's Bath and its how they called depression back in the days. 

It is a very shilling movie, not for the faint hearted but I highly recommend!",1731333642.0,,29,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gostua/movie_des_teufels_bad/,False

Women are fed up, and for a good reason. This movement has seen a lot of growth in the past couple of days and it makes me really happy, but I keep seeing people label it as a “sex strike”. I’ve seen this from other women, journalists, conservatives, moderates, etc. I think the reason a lot of people don’t think that it’s going to accomplish anything is because they’re missing the entire point. They focus in on the abstinence as the main point of us “taking back our power” in this movement, but that’s not what it’s about. No s3x with men is only 1 of the 4 Bs, and we’re already starting to push for 6B and 7B. It’s not about being celibate ladies, it’s an entire lifestyle change! It frustrates me so much that people think this is some sort of violent protest movement meant to hurt men. The point is that we’re protecting our peace. We’re supporting other women, taking our spaces back, refusing to be tied to men who put all of the pressure of a relationship and the cognitive, emotional, and physical labor that come with it onto us! Women are married for years before they realize their husbands don’t respect them. The point is to be free. Full income, self-fulfilling hobbies, supportive women-based communities and friendships.

She is the most beautiful, wonderful, kind and caring woman I know. She and my dad are aging like fine wine, and I’ve never doubted that they love each other. I’ve wanted nothing more than to have a relationship like theirs since I was 9, leading into having my very own daughter that I could pour my own love into and cherish beyond worlds.


But I am also a victim of rape and sexual assault. I am a survivor of childhood rape. I can’t even think about getting a Pap smear without having a full blown breakdown. I have chronic PTSD and a possible TBI. I know better than most people in my area what 2025 will bring, because I’ve lived it already.


The dream of being a mother someday to a child that I could love as much as my own mother loved me, has been the only thing keeping me from suicide. But the election has shown me that my circle of trust is best kept minuscule, if not down to only me. If sacrificing this dream ensures my survival, then it must be done.

CharmingClaims,t2_aiqjjdk5,t3_1goukiv,,Men are getting off to our fears,"I can’t believe this is happening. I wish I were wrong but an arms race between the sexes has begun similar to how female ducks evolved a more complex reproductive tract to fend off rape, male ducks started evolving penises that could circumvent that. Similar to the ducks, as we’re finding ways to protect ourselves, men are finding ways to rape us anyway and they’re getting off of it. Starting a few days ago, ever since women finally had enough and started caring about themselves, men have become increasingly angry at women going their own way. They get angry at us protecting ourselves and their response is to ridicule us. This has now taken a turn for the worse, instead of ridiculing us they’re coming up with what if scenarios - What if I tase her first? How then is she going to defend herself? - What if I stick a carrot in and remove the anti-rape device? - How long is she going to hide? She's going to be out alone at some point - It’s like they want to feel superior and they view our defense measures as a threat to them. I can’t believe we’re living in a time where men seriously would get a gun to use against us but it makes sense. They have a completely different outlook on rape.

I don’t think their hatred for rape is for the same reasons as ours. They seem to care about it being an unfair strategy, while they’re putting in time to court a girl, they view a rapist as a cheater. They also seem to care about it more when it could affect their family members since they see it as an infringement on their property. Overall I just think they’ve been socially conditioned to hate rape just because they’ve seen our reactions to it. They can however easily be deconditioned as is happening now.

I think most of you remember how they reacted to the bear vs man thing. They got mad at us for saying we’d rather be mauled by a bear than to be raped. Their reasoning, if you can call it that, is that if we would go to such great lengths to protect our freedom to choose who to give access to our bodies and that person isn’t them, then we’re hurting their feelings. Their feelings are hurt because we'd rather die than get raped. To them, this is a huge hit to their self perception. It wouldn't surprise me if men think that when push comes to shove they can convince a woman that being raped isn't worse than being mauled because unless they use violence it's just sex and that's a sacrifice we can make for them.

I’m disgusted and I might delete this. I just wanted to get this out that you shouldn’t discuss this with men. Just don’t tell them how you’ll protect yourself. They’re getting off to our fears, don’t let them.

Here are some options that can help us protect ourselves from pregnancy & pregnancy related complications that could potentially be life threatening.

Implant - Nexplanon
DMPA Injection - Depo Provera
Hormonal IUDs : Mirena, Lilleta, Skyla
Non Hormonal IUD: Paragard

Permanent contraception - Tubal Ligation

- **natural**: what happens after, the experienced result of a given action or decision. natural consequences are about replacing your words with their experience

EXAMPLES

- artificial: getting too close to a hot stove will burn you
- **natural**: I touched the hot stove and it burned me
———
- artificial: a billion people driving ICE powered cars every day will warm the earth, increasing ocean levels, storms, and fires
- **natural**: storms are getting more intense/frequent and storm surges are both higher and further reaching. Why has my flood insurance tripled in the last 2 years?

Today's teatime is about nature, our original mother, and how we relate to her. How she nurtures all living things so that we can embody that same nurture in our lives.

I'll go first:

Today I decided to befriend my local corvids. I recently discovered that I have a peanut sensitivity and was unsure about what to do with the can of now inedible peanuts that I have. I sat outside and saw a pair of local crow-like birds and remembered how amazingly intelligent they are and that they can recognize humans individually and will even pass on that recognition to their next generation.

One cawed loudly nearby and I wondered what s/he was saying.

Then I remembered stories of people befriending corvids and thought about a friend I know who befriends them as well.

I'm now on a mission to befriend the local birds, starting with my can of peanuts. This is a new way that I connect with nature.

It always baffled me, because most males’ lives don’t change anyhow after having a child, so why aren’t there any expectations towards fathers, let alone single men to be rich and successful?

It’s like putting insane pressure on women. You either are a hot SAHM with 5 healthy children or you are a fit sexy corporate “girlboss” (hate this infantilizing term btw.) earning six figures by 30, or your existence is pointless. 

4B as a movement should stray away from what liberal feminists have been trying to put in our heads - that the only alternative to having children is being rich and educated. Let me stress it however, it’s ESSENTIAL to have some sort of stable income, that allows you to live at least a very basic life without having to rely on a male. 

Women are allowed to live their own peaceful lives, working for a minimum wage, playing games and cuddling with their pets in the evenings! Their lives are just as meaningful. We aren’t hitting any “wall” at 30 because as long as we decenter men - there’s no imaginary wall to fear, made up to force women to submit out of fear they will become undesirable.

This election showed us that not only does this country hate us, but they love rapists more than us (honestly, I think to the men who voted for him, him being a rapist was a plus because either they relate or it’s just another way to upset women). I really thought we’d have a female president. I’ve wanted one since I was a kid; I always felt weird about only men having been our rulers. I was a teenager when Hillary lost and it hurt. This time is so much worse. I had to cut off the only two men in my life, friends of 5+ years, because they didn’t bother voting, even though I’ve always stood up for their rights as black men even though I’m white but they couldn’t return the favor. I have been doing the 4B movement for two years and I’ve always known men hated us to a degree, but I didn’t realize that they want us to go back in the 50s—their view of us hasn’t progressed at all in 100 years—or that so many of them were actual diagnosable narcissists who won’t shut the fuck up whining about women not doing whatever bullshit I’m too pissed to even write about how insane their justifications and victimhood and idiocy has been. 

I don’t want to go to outside anymore especially in the city. I don’t want to be around men. I don’t want to deal with their horrible looks or harassment, now knowing that it’s coming from a place of actual power and not just pathetic insecurity.

Especially as a woman who has experienced so much misogyny and long-term sexual violence and rape throughout my life and had to go to therapy to finally work through it. I already felt like men had so much power over my life. It just feels pointless now. It never ends. I was *finally* feeling less traumatized and terrified of every man being a rapist. But I still had the target on me so even if I just went to a bar or whatever, I’d always attract a really pushy, violent predator, even though I never ever tried to interact with men. Now so many of them have outed themselves as being rapists or rape apologists. And our society clearly doesn’t care and rape rates are going to go up while rape apologism is strengthening. It feels inevitable that many of us will face sexual violence again and I was already so traumatized and scared before this I don’t know what to do.

Ok_Sir5430,t2_d5mpg42j,t3_1gp3n6j,,"We’re being put against each other, once again","Hey y’all, I’m writing this post to shed some light on something that’s quite worrying: 
On TikTok, some women have started following the 4B movement, and some other women have started following the movement of shaving their heads to take their power back on their bodies by showing they can do whatever they want with it following the ‘’Your body, my choice’’ quote, IE shaving their heads. Some women have also followed both movements. 
I think they’re good and inspiring, as their goal is to make women the sole owners of their own bodies. I don’t think there’s any harm in those movements at all.

Only now, some people have started saying that both movements are the same, and that women following the 4B movement are shaving their heads to look ugly and repulsive so that men don’t want to approach them. This rumour has upset many women who suffer from conditions that make them lose their hair or that make it impossible for them to grow hair. I would be upset too if I suffered from such a condition and I was told by some people that other women are ‘’following this stupid 4B movement where they all shave their heads to look as ugly as possible’’.

While some women might have said that they were shaving their heads to be less appealing to men (I have yet to have seen any women who shaved their heads give this explanation for their action, though I might not have dug deep enough), it’s absolutely not the majority! This whole rumour is just being said to imply that women who are bald are inherently ugly, and that other women who are not bald think that too, which is all just absolutely and ridiculously not true.

This whole situation is happening because, once again, women are being put against one another. We’re being divided. The 4B movement is now demonized even more by people, mostly other women, who are hurt by this kind of rumours that have come out these past couple of days. Not to mention women who already had their hair cut short and who are now scared to be put in the same basket as the ‘’crazy and mean 4B movement girls’’ by other people…

Stay vigilant and make sure that the women around you know they are loved and that the goal of the 4B movement and the Shave your head movement is to empower every single women, not to cherry pick some and leave the rest in the gutter.

greyyskyy,t2_y52l7n2nf,t3_1gp5ke6,,We are the bear ,"Came across this on Tiktok . All rights to artist @chaoswithmissjess ~ she’s working on merch.

This isn’t 4B specific but it’s female empowerment specific & I felt captured our power in unity.  Art is subjective & this image spoke to me deeply. I want to share how it makes me feel.

It isn’t just through our unity that we have been able to strike fear into the souls of men, it is by our birth. Men have ALWAYS feared women being empowered. The backlash we are experiencing from men online is because they are scared. At their core they know they hold no value. 

They have always known this. Equality is a threat, because they have no value. The more women  that are financially independent, educated & connected with other women the less likely they are to be with a man. The stats also indicate this. 

Men abuse, manipulate, gaslight & trap women in relationships because they aren’t normal likeable human beings. They know the only way to be in a woman’s presence & keep her  is to break her down emotionally, abuse her & remove her rights.

The rise of incels shows you just how pathetic and unlikable they are as people. The history books also support this. 

When women have options to survive, men are removed from the list. 

This image to me speaks of women not just in solidarity, but empowered as individuals. The spirit of the grizzly bear is highly symbolic, as if it’s our totem animal emboldening us to be confident, fearless & strong.  As if it’s reminding us that we aren’t helpless but empowered.

Femininity has long been connected to passivity, weakness, motherhood, sensitivity.. yet nothing about Mother Nature would indicate she’s such. It’s a small facet of the bigger truth.

As women we can create life. But, we also bleed each month & connect to a cycle of death & rebirth. 

Mother Nature may bloom beautiful flowers in the spring while soft ocean waves gently touch the shore one day, and in the next she may unleash a  violent storm that devastates an entire civilization. 

We are the rage of our ancestors, the voice of the women who were silenced & we stand now as one amongst thousands for our rights, our freedom and our power. 

It is long overdue that we remembered who the fuck we are & what happens when we unify as one for something bigger than ourselves. 

We move forward, embracing a new future, one WE craft for ourselves and with eachother & leave men in the dust.

But if they try to fuck with us on our journey there, they will be met with the very bear they claimed not to fear. ",1731365076.0,,943,0,post,https://i.redd.it/gn87a95apc0e1.jpeg,False

Runswithtoast,t2_dm456,t3_1gpa95i,,Expanding 4B: The Essential Role of Contraceptive Access in True Empowerment,"The core of the 4B movement is about empowering individuals to live freely and thoughtfully, unburdened by societal pressures that limit personal autonomy brought about by the patriarchy. 

But for this vision to become reality, we need to recognize an essential addendum: 
**widespread access to contraception.**

Contraceptive access allows people to make choices on their own terms, breaking cycles of dependency and paving the way for genuine freedom. **Without it, too many are left bound to lives they didn’t fully choose**, often without resources to find alternatives. 

If we’re serious about 4B’s vision, we must push for policies that ensure everyone has access to the tools and education needed to make truly independent choices. 

**Passive protest is essential, but we must not be passive when it comes to helping the least fortunate have access to contraceptives in order to participate 4B's vision.**

**Anyone committed to the 4B movement should actively work to support women who are constrained by patriarchal values in gaining their freedom.** Access to birth control is a crucial first step; without it, many women have little choice but to bear children who may inherit and continue these restrictive beliefs, perpetuating the cycle for another generation.

I cannot stress how essential this is,
it only takes adam and eve to make cain and able.... In other words, the patriarchy is like an flea infestation... only two need to reproduce to bring about a whole new reinfestation... reproduction freedom is so important, so i hope it can become an official addendum to the 4B movemeny.

Do as much aa you can to help.
Donate, volunteer, do anything and everything you can to help the women that have little autonomy

galaxynephilim,t2_5ur2xuez,t3_1gpf423,,Conscience lives in few men ,"Men are raised to be sociopathic and seems like it really is futile hoping for anything to change because these men do not TRULY ever get better at anything even if it seems like it, they only get better at appearing to have gotten better & at manipulating, and they cannot tell the difference. They seem to believe there is no difference and they don't even have a concept of having a conscience. It all goes through the pure Machiavellian filter of these men. Everyone's like ""most people aren't that bad"" but honestly I think the majority of men do not have a conscience. I think of all the men in my family and the guys I knew in school. I think of the one single guy I thought I could trust who, in his 40s, told me he got a ""girlfriend"" who turned out to be a 16 year old girl from the Philippines and he acted like I was the one betraying him for throwing our whole decade-long friendship away over it. They act like so many horrible things are just no big deal except to the extent that it personally affects them or their ""property"" as if women, children, and animals are their slaves or objects to be exploited for resources. This is THE NORM for men today and I feel completely powerless to be able to do anything to change it in the slightest.

I strongly feel there are 2 types of people in this world. When you're walking through a store and another person approaches in your aisle, there are those that move to avoid collision, and there are those who don't care and just keep walking. It seems to me that that majority of the time, this is how it works. 

I have always been the type to move to accommodate. Always. It's bothered me some, but I put no real thought into it until yesterday when I decided that I would no longer make room for men in these situations. If a man and I are approaching in an aisle, then I'll no longer move if I'm already on my side of the aisle. He can either move or allow me to plow into him. Either way, I've chosen this small act as a way to begin to rebuild my independence. 

It's a small win, but one that I feel will help to erase those patriarchal neuropathways.

mullatomochaccino,t2_1cpowwsc3w,t3_1gppyb1,,Keeping Yourself Safe Online and IRL,"Quick PSA for all the women here. When engaging online (in general but especially when involved in something with the potential to stir up controversy) I cannot express enough how important it is to practice basic OpSec.

>Operations Security (OPSEC) is a systematic process that protects sensitive information and activities from adversaries. It involves identifying, controlling, and protecting critical information, and analyzing threats, vulnerabilities, and risks. The goal of OPSEC is to prevent adversaries from gaining information that could give them an advantage.

In layman's terms, this means you should refrain from posting any private or identifying information about yourself in places where people can find it and potentially use it against you.

**Personal and Private Information-** Be selective with whom you give this information. Anything that can give away your identity or location. Refrain from broadcasting your full legal name, your birthdate, your address. This goes the same for when you're talking about relatives and friends. Even broadcasting the exact town or city you live in can be used with other given information to locate you.

**Photographs and Images-** Everything above can also be applied to your images. Be selective of where you share pictures of yourself. Be mindful of what else is IN your pictures (IDs, bank cards, addresses, paperwork, etc) and reconsider sharing any images that might compromise your health and safety. Remember: The Internet is Forever.

**Usernames and Email-** I can't tell you the amount of times I see people using their real names or even their birthdates in usernames and email. Do not do this. Another good practice is to use different screen names for different platforms whenever possible. This makes it more difficult to track your online footprint or trace you back to another platform (like Facebook) where people can find more personal information on you.

SwordsOfSanghelios,t2_1oxeuer0,t3_1gps950,,A lot of people seem to like to misinterpret the 4B movement ,"I literally just saw a post on instagram a few minutes ago saying women practicing the 4B movement have gone so far left that they’ve swung right back around to being right wing conservatives. 

Then there’s the Wikipedia editing that happened only a few days ago. Even non 4B related, I saw another woman posted saying she was celebrating that Trump won because women shouldn’t be leading men, which then had another comment saying that if women were meant to lead then Trump wouldn’t have beaten two women during elections. Like????

It’s all just insanity to me. I’m disappointed that people are willfully choosing to ignore the 4B movement and where it stems from. They could easily educate themselves on where it comes from and the reasons why and while I won’t ever hate women for supporting men, I will always be giving the side eye to women who think women shouldn’t and cannot lead. 

There are historically many and I mean MANY societies where they were lead equally by men and women or were matriarchal societies. This idea that men built society while women sat away in their pretty little castles only further erases the women who already had their work stolen, their names erased, or the women who had to pretend to be men just to be able to join the army or be a painter. Women from all over the globe, regardless if they are cis or trans have been disrespected and enough is enough.

greyyskyy,t2_y52l7n2nf,t3_1gpsicr,,Women’s martial art training ~ a detailed insight ,"

I have been seeing the rise of women desiring to begin martial arts training since the election. I have always been a huge advocate for this training for women in particular because it can absolutely save your life. As a female martial artist, I’d like to share some of my own insight & shed light on some different facets. This will likely be a bit long, but I will break this down into a few points. 

- Efficacy. Martial arts training is highly effective for women, the ability to leverage your own body weight, control someone else’s & be able to submit, control, or break bones can save your life. Size & strength are absolutely important. You WILL learn how helpless you are when training & that should fuel you to become as dangerous as possible. The average joe ~ an untrained male that doesn’t work out can easily be submitted by a skilled female martial artist. However, if he’s above average in size & erratic from drugs or alcohol consumption this can pose a massive threat even with training. The longer you train, & the better you get the better chance you have at survival. We use a term often, “become harder to kill, and 1% better everyday” this can be the difference between life and death. It can be the difference between being raped and not being raped. I must emphasize the importance in its efficacy IF YOU STICK WITH IT.
Putting in the hours aka “mat time” and live sparring sessions when your ready is how you will advance your skills. 
Martial arts are not fool proof, but they will greatly shift your confidence & increase your survivability.  

-Types of training: I have trained since I was a kid in a variety of self defense techniques. These is are personal recommendations as a woman. 
* Krav Maga: NOT a martial art. This is pure self defense. This craft was developed by the Israeli self defense forces and is still currently utilized. It gets alot of flack amongst martial arts because it IS NOT a martial art.  What to expect training Krav: You will learn to diffuse situations. This includes roleplaying hostage situations & building situational awareness for a multitude of scenarios including active shooters, or violent spouse. When words and disengaging do not work you will learn how to defend yourself in the most effective way possible. You will train fundamentals: Chokes, bear hugs, being pinned down, grabbed from behind, etc.. to advanced methods: Held at gun point by a variety of guns, being attacked with batons, knife fights, etc.. 
Krav Maga Is something I HIGHLY recommend. However, there are McDojo Bullshit schools that exist for every place, do your research. 
TRIGGER WARNING: The Krav training I did was quite intense. I purposely chose a school with a harsh reputation as I wanted real life situations to be emulated. I highly recommend this. However, it’s very triggering and overstimulating to be screamed at, worn down & “attacked”. This is done intentionally to prepare your nervous system & change your fight or flight response. If you can remain calm and imbue technique into muscle memory, you might be able to save your life. 

* Muay Thai: The art of 8 limbs developed in Thailand. This is a full contact standing martial art utilizing strikes, elbows, sweeps, knees, elbows, shins, fists, & clinches. It’s aggressive & in my opinion the most multifaceted standing martial art to learn. 
* Brazilian Jiu Jitsu: A ground based martial art traditionally done in gi (uniform) but is also available in no-gi (rash guards). BJJ by its very design was created to leverage technique over strength, making it a FANTASTIC choice for women to train in as it utilizes techniques to gain control over a larger and stronger opponent. You will learn to break bones, twist people into pretzels, leverage body weight, & ultimately be a badass.
Trigger warning: BJJ is CLOSE CONTACT. It can be extremely triggering. This sport is male dominated & has some of the worse male ego bullshit I’ve ever seen. The men can truly be insufferable. Men will be up against your body pinning you down, and between your legs. This can be triggering. They will also probably avoid training with you sometimes when it comes to “rolling” which is live sparring because you’re a woman. There are many BJJ schools with WOMENS ONLY classes & I would suggest joining that to begin with. When you’re ready, branch out and join some co-ed classes. The truth is, you NEED to train with men to know how to actually defend yourself against them. 

* Wrestling, MMA, Judo: All fantastic choices. Wrestling is aggressive & focuses on take downs and pins, the body control you learn is invaluable making wrestlers a force to be reckoned with. MMA is usually a hybrid class that has elements of all martial arts, so it includes striking and grappling. Solid technique and well rounded. Judo, a personal favorite of mine that is mainly throws. So if someone ever runs up on you, you can easily leverage their body weight and make them go flying. Idk if you’ve ever fell on the ground hard before, but that shit can break the ribs on impact. Probably wouldn’t be my first choice as much as I love it, but it’s something that’s highly effective as well.

TO AVOID: Karate, Taekwondo, Aikido, anything of that nature that’s going to be more art based and virtually useless in a real fight. Also, do your research with gyms and take a trial class, you want to look for a place that has a good female base, maybe some women’s only classes, and a place that isn’t too soft. If it’s too soft you won’t get good training. You want something that is regulated well. 

The reality: Most gyms will have a male owner and instructor. We can limit where we spend our money, but this is something that is invaluable to learn for yourself so I wouldn’t choose to not train just because the owner is male. Personally, I try to find couple owned businesses. Where I live there are a handful, where the wife teaches a solid half of the classes. 

Misogyny: It’s everywhere. You will deal with it here too. I’d suggest using it as fuel to become skilled enough to whoop their ass. Think of it as your villain origin story, or the training a strong character endures at the beginning of their journey. I personally love comics & things of that sort, so I’ll view it as my underdog story.  Then one day, everything sets in and you beat their ass and it was allllll worth it. 

Important to note: You can take a single self defense class or train 2x a month and it will probably not do you any good. You will only become a badass by training 2-3x a week and sticking with it. You need the mat time. Do it with a girlfriend or alone. Find your space, fuck it carve out your space. Build your confidence, your skills and your body. I GUARANTEE you will walk different, be different & step into the most empowering space of your life if you give it a chance and tap into your potential.

GrouchyTower6193,t2_14o0kmkcvj,t3_1gq5zog,,I have been a master at making excuses for men ,"I’ve been lying to myself my whole life and I’ve been making excuses for inexcusable behaviors from men since ever! 

I made excuses for the kids that in elementary and middle school used to bully and sexually harass me touching my boobs and ass without my consent. I kept respecting them for most of my adult life telling myself things like “they were kids”. 

I’ve been used like a sex doll for all of my teens from fuck boys that would deceive me with fake love to have sex with me and then ghost me the day after, and I’ve kept quiet, I was destroyed on the inside but I coped telling myself and the world “well I consented to sex with them while I was not in an official relationship so I knew they could leave at any moment, it was my fault”. 

I made excuses for my ex boyfriend that couldn’t even dedicate 20 minutes of his precious time choosing a present for my birthday and was literally with me just for what he was getting out of me: sex and domestic labor “he’s avoidant, but he’s a nice guy”. 

I made excuses for my second ex boyfriend that abused me like no one, raped me, isolated me with his extreme jealousy, slutshamed me, and the more you can imagine you can put. “Yeah he buys me roses and takes me to expensive restaurants, he loves me, it was just friendship with that girl”, the first time that I caught him flirting with another girl. “He was drunk and he says he’s sorry and will never do that again”, the first time that he hit me. 

It took me having found my life in serious danger to finally break that enchantment and stop humanizing them and seeing good where there’s only evil, entitlement and selfishness.

Something brainwashed me at a very young age, I can’t identify what or who, but something at some point put into my mind that “I needed a man”, that that emptiness I felt, it was because there wasn’t a man loving me. That emptiness was so big that I overcame EVERY KIND OF DISRESPECT instead of letting go of the delusion and accept reality. I analyzed my life a lot, I’ve been thriving the periods I’ve been single, while I’ve been miserable when there was a man. I really can’t explain how I’ve always been ignoring everything my experience was teaching me and longing and desperately searching for that dreamy love story.

coolaf95,t2_piqs4c,t3_1gq6ng9,,"Excerpts from Pete Hegseth's book, ""The War on Warriors."" ","In light of the recent news regarding Pete Hegseth's nomination for Secretary of Defense I decided to do a bit of research on him.

He has written a book titled, ""The War on Warriors."" As a female SSG in the Army, I took a vested interest in Chapter Five of his book: ""The (Deadly) Obsession with Women Warriors.""

Below are some direct quotes.

""Every unit knows that social justice, transgender, woke training is the top priority.""

""I'm going to say something politically incorrect that is perfectly commonsensical observation. Dad's push us to take risks. Mom's put the training wheels on our bike. We need mom's, but not in the military, especially in combat units.""

""The gender integration of the military is a huge part of our modern confusion about the goals of war. In particular, the choice to put women in combat roles.""

""Unlike the mythologies of great Amazonian Warriors in the Greek mythology, most of the world's accounts of women in war were connected to seductive and sexual power.""

""There are examples in history of women in combat roles. But one is hard pressed to find many outside of religious or mythical settings that have anything close to a positive military outcome.""

""Women bring life into the world. Their role in war is to make it a less deathly experience.""

""Women are life givers, regardless of what the abortion industry might want us to think.""

""To create a society of warrior women you must seperate them first from men and then from the natural purpose of their core instincts.""

""If you train a group of men to treat women equally on the battlefield then you will be hard pressed to ask them to treat women differently at home.""

""Our military now trains our metaphorical life givers to be combat life takers and then when they become biological life givers our DoD and VA help them be baby life takers in the name of keeping them on the team as combat life takers. The logic of evil.""

""The number of female veterans seeking abortions is off the charts. Of the nearly one million females in the VA health system, nearly 18% have sought at least one abortion. Thank you for serving our country. Now we will help you kill your unborn child.""

""They (VA) claim that PTSD and mental health are not the only reasons that women need free abortions. There is of course the fear of reprimand when they get pregnant. Usually happens right after deployment orders are cut.""

""Abortion is not between a doctor and a woman. And I define a woman as a person that is actually a woman. It is a now a decision made between her doctor, her therapist, herself, her veteran advocate, and her first line supervisor in the military. Who could possibly argue with that logic.""

I am legitimately terrified that this man could potentially be running our military.

Whenever I see moms toting their babies around, all I feel is anxiety and dread—thinking about how trapped they are, how limited their lives must be. I understand that many mothers don’t think that way about their situations, but I think it’s even worse because I’m currently living in an Asian country (not Korea, but close) where patriarchal values still reign supreme despite declining birth rates. I always wonder how many women actually wanted children versus how many were pressured or coerced into it. I also wonder how many women thought they wanted children, but ended up regretting it later.

Truthfully, I think childbirth and childrearing are a source of oppression, no matter a woman’s situation. It demands sacrifice, and women’s sacrifice is so fetishized because of course it serves men when women give and give and give. I have absolutely zero hope in men, as they’ve given me reason after reason to look down upon them, womankind’s only hope is to make humans go extinct. Or, at the very least, sex-selective abortion for male fetuses should be normalized. In general, using men’s tactics against them should be considered a viable means of protest.

If you haven't read it, one instrument of the 'Party' (the totalitarian government and antagonist of the novel) is the Junior Anti-Sex League, who actively vilify sex and insist that procreation should be done exclusively through artificial insemination. Here are two passages from the very first chapter in which the male protagonist ogles a woman who belongs to this group (and also fantasises about raping and killing her):

""She was a bold-looking girl, of about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because of the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. He disliked all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was always the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted adherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy. But this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most."" 

""... Winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind. He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. Better than before, moreover he realised WHY it was that he hated her. He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.""

When I first read 1984 as a teenager, I don't know if this stood out to me, but as an adult (and having been practising 4b for a few years already), I find it so disgusting. Even the protagonist, Winston, who we as readers are expected to root for, finds the time to be a woman-hating creep amidst the terror the Party is inflicting on the people, and also puts the blame for the Party squarely at the feet of women, the ""most bigoted adherents of the Party"". All of this despite the fact that Oceania (the fictional country which the Party governs) remains a totalitarian patriarchy overseen by Big Brother. He sexualises a woman while he dreams of torturing and killing her because he hates her so much for not fucking him. He hates the ""aggressive symbol of chastity"". How *dare* women not have sex with men? Women *deserve* to be hated by men for choosing celibacy, Orwell insists. And guess what? This woman, whom Winston dreams of torturing, raping, and killing, is his love interest, Julia! He even *tells her* he wanted to rape and murder her, considering it to be some kind of ""love-offering"" for god knows what reason, and she just laughs ""delightedly"" and completely glosses over it, I suppose because she's nOt LiKe OtHeR gIrLs. They go on to have lots of sex to prove how awful ~~women denying men sex~~ the Party is. Incidentally, Julia also insists that the only real reason everyone is so enthusiastic about the Party is that they're going slightly mad from the lack of sex - ""All this marching up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour"". 

In a book that has been incredibly successful and influential in its depiction of totalitarianism, the excessive and bizarre misogyny really waters down any message Orwell was trying to convey, and, frankly, has repulsed me so much that I never want to read it again. He touches on the Party's infiltration and destruction of intimacy and trust between friends, lovers, and families, but so much of the text is focussed on sex (or the lack thereof) that it seems to be Winston's (and Orwell's) main gripe. Indeed, at the end of novel (spoilers), Winston and Julia's relationship is discovered by the Party after a friend betrays them; they are tortured and brainwashed to the point of renouncing their love (the most memorable scene is the torturers bringing rats to eat Winston's face and him eventually begging them to ""do it to Julia!""), and eventually randomly meet in a park months later, where Winston muses that:

""It did not matter, nothing mattered. They could have lain down on the ground and done THAT if they wanted to. His flesh froze with horror at the thought of it"". 

Orwell's vitriol towards women in '1984' is absolutely appalling. If you contrast it to novels like Margaret Atwood's 'The Handmaid's Tale', the difference is stark: actual rape (as opposed to Winston's fantasies) just doesn't really exist at all in '1984' - it's simply not something Orwell gives any thought to. And why would he? He never had to fear it. But in Atwood's work, the imprisonment, rape, and forced pregnancy of women is the dominant theme. Even when creating a horrific fictional world with an all-powerful totalitarian government that systematically brainwashes and tortures its people, one of the worst things a man can think of is that he won't be able to have sex with a woman.",1731507492.0,,213,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gqdvvt/dystopian_fiction_written_by_men_centres_on/,False

I’ve had ex’s put me down for my biggest dream be “only a mom”.  My last relationship ended this week; and was 3 years and the first relationship involving a child- I was present in his son’s life from 2.5-5.5; I love his son so very much.  During this time though- it really had solidified how much I don’t believe in men to be strong, caring, empathetic, nurturing, level headed parental figures and I would cringe at how he would raise his child; however I could only say and do so much. As his son gets older; I’m seeing the faults and lack of structure and how it’s effecting his son.  It was a battle to stay for his child; and do my best to be a supportive figure and control the environment and live in a hostile environment myself; or turn the page. And here we are…. 

I am all for the 4b movement; and can easily by pass 3 of the bs without hesitation; but the idea of never being pregnant and a mom is hard to swallow; and not that I even want to have a child with a man- I’d love to do it myself; but realize that’s just not also in my cards. And although I’ve been very active in raising kids- I can’t imagine actually being a completely single parent… but also cannot imagine not ever being a parent, and my biological clock is ticking- by no means will the changes be needed be done in any near future to have a society where women are respected and valued.  I am such a caretaker at heart and hope I can align my career or hobbies with helping others in some way to fill the void.

Appreciate the little things everyday. Look for the beauty in your everyday life, even if it's as simple as a pretty flower or the way the milk in your coffee swirls. It sounds dumb, but it works. Focus on the moment throughout the day when you have the opportunity (how the sun feels on your face, etc.).

Don't wait. If you're waiting for the ""right time"" to do something, stop it. Leave that crappy relationship, book that trip, start that class. Best case scenario, you'll regret wasting that time later on, worst case scenario you never get the chance to do it. If money, family, whatever obligations are stopping you, take whatever baby steps you can toward your goal today (save $1 a day, write out a plan to get there, etc.). 

I understand I'm writing this from a place of privilege and that lots of circumstances and obstacles exist for people.

The ""no childbirth"" stance is about addressing the inequalities that motherhood still brings. Mothers experience significant financial strain and shoulder extra caregiving responsibilities with little support, which not only widens the gender pay gap but also makes independence harder to achieve.

By refusing parenthood, we’re calling out the governments that don’t value or support mothers. It’s not that we’re against children, but it’s a statement challenging the expectations that keep women in traditional, limiting roles.

If you want to become a single mother you are not living a 4B lifestyle. 

Now don't get me wrong, every woman is 100% FREE to do whatever she likes, **if you want kids, then have kids. But admit that 4B is not for you, do not look for validation in this subreddit and ask that 4B's meaning can be changed or encourage other women to do the same.**

Choosing this path has brought immense peace and significantly improved my mental well-being.  It's liberating to be free from the emotional labor and potential for manipulation that can often accompany relationships with men.

butwhyyy2112,t2_eyzjbm3,t3_1gqlox9,,I can already sense the responses but I wanted to get this off my chest / see if anyone has found anything ,"Not trying to put anyone out about this, but I was super excited to join this group/movement because I’m very eager to decenter men - which is what I understood the 4b movement to be. However, I almost need a trigger warning on every post in this sub, as nearly every post I see is about men and the violence against women that they either perpetrate or enable as individuals or as large governing bodies. 

I understand this is intended to be a safe place to discuss issues we feel we want to discuss. I also understand it’s reasonable to share news that is directly affecting us as women. I’m just so emotionally exhausted from the constant bombardment of violence against women; both on an individual basis and on a large, systemic scale. 

I was so thrilled to find a sub that was for women, full of women, so we could engage fully with each other without the constant vigilance, triggering nonsense, and tone policing that having men present often necessitates. But honestly, I feel worse after reading half these posts. 

I know, I know: don’t let the door hit me in the ass on the way out. But like, is there a sub that actually decenters men? Please tag it below thankssss internet sisters 💕✌🏻

**EDIT: (and trigger warning below for mention of sa) and apology to those who feel I am saying their experiences should not be shared.**

As this is common topic in the comments I want to say that I do think it is valuable to be able to vent and commiserate and discuss the negative things that impact us as women daily. Like men. 

The essence of what I am saying is that I am here at this point adopting the 4b movement as a way to take this constant threat of violence and harassment and abuse out of the center of my life and interactions. I love the idea of flare or tagging for topics so that those needing a place to vent have it, and those looking to not constantly see examples of violence done against a woman’s body and life can have that too. 

**(Here’s the trigger warning)** I know that men are trash and from individual experiences to systemic issues women are at best oppressed and at worst being raped and murdered on a large scale. That’s why I’m here in the 4b movement. I am not trying to ask those with experiences to share to not; I am saying that my understanding of the 4b movement is to take men out of the center of our focus, but this sub has (just lately been) a great deal of focus on them and the horrible things they’re doing to people who look like me, which is not necessarily my aim in being here. 

I am not here to silence anyone or tell anyone their thoughts or feelings are not for sharing. I myself am part of other subs where this is indeed the focus of discussion. I am asking this community where to find that sub that is just women living and fostering camaraderie and talking about literally anything other than these male parasites. 

**I am very sorry to have triggered folks or given the impression that their traumas and experiences should be kept quiet, as that is the furthest thing from what I believe. Voicing our experiences and finding strength in our communities is vital and I am not trying to take that away from anyone. This is me asking this community for directions on where to go to find the thing I’m looking for, not me telling this community how to exist.**",1731527243.0,,121,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gqlox9/i_can_already_sense_the_responses_but_i_wanted_to/,False

Think about the amount of men who can do their jobs normally at work and can follow instructions or look things up but magically at home they become incapable of even pushing the most basic buttons like running the dishwasher or washing machine and need a woman to do it because they don’t know how. Then when you teach them they constantly don’t wrong on purpose so you become so tired that you just automatically do it for them. And this becomes your miserable life. That’s the kind of psychological stuff they do to make women tired of fighting against them.

Therusticate,t2_2xe5aocp,t3_1gqyoz3,,Intersectionality and 4b (long post) ,"I’m nervous to ask, mostly because I’m so new to the movement, but I have found so much community and comfort around you all so I feel I need to bring it up.

The 4b movement is pretty straightforward. And those are values that I deem necessary for my safety and survival, plus, it’s a feminist movement with emphasis on supporting women and building community with each other. It’s also a personal movement; you participate however is best for you. 

For example: Some of us don’t entertain platonic relationships with men at all, some are comfortable with their queer communities, and others are okay with cis men as friends.

Another example is that you’re already married but deciding against children in this landscape where that would be risky.

I’ve been an intersectional feminist for years. This includes the trans community and sex workers. I have not found hate towards any of these groups in this forum, which is great!

My ask is this: are trans people, and sex workers welcomed here? My personal values are that 

A. Trans people undergo pressure like ours and then some to put it lightly. Trans men have the choice to give birth or not, especially when they’re attracted to men. Trans women have the options to date or marry cis men. Non-binary people have several circumstances that would let them find solace in this community.

B. Women (and trans people) who take part in sex work do so oftentimes out of necessity or for a host of other reasons (I can’t speak for them.) it is a job, including content creation centered towards several different audiences but often men. 

We have heard pornstars speak out about the industry, we have heard compromising positions that others have found themselves in as a result of sex work that is NEVER their fault. 

My ultimate question is: Can I in good conscience tell these people that we’re a community that will support and welcome them? 

I would like to think so. The majority of people I talk to and respond to don’t necessarily have these circumstances. I don’t have these circumstances. I’m a cis, bisexual woman. But we can’t ignore that we do what we have to in order to make a living and survive. 

How many of us work for men in an office, trade or other workspace? There is a system that branches into so many other walks of life and I would hope that we can support each other here no matter what that looks like. 

As an intersectional feminist, is 4b conducive to that, and can I recommend it to these communities to adapt to their circumstances? Will they be empowered here like I have considering their necessities like employment or gender outside of “cis man?” 

Our goal, as I understand it, is to decentralize men from our lives. 
A sex worker could embody all of these things except where necessary for them. Most trans friends already do so.

I hope I’m just asking the obvious, but I don’t see it talked about a lot and I’d like reassurance if it’s there. I’m not talking about people enthusiastically supporting the porn industry, I’m talking about people who are there already that might need support in this community who are in support of us but need to continue to make a living.

The recent goings on in the US are finding a lot of people very suddenly and I just want to know that we’re a safe community for all walks of life who want to adapt 4b in any way they can.

glowfawn,t2_6hygrdrny,t3_1gqyzji,,The Bumble Fumble shows that women have been turning away from modern dating long before 4B reached the West,"In their apology, Bumble said ""Our ads referencing celibacy were an attempt to lean into a community frustrated by modern dating …"" and the thing is why? My theory is that this is not just about targeting a niche group of women who don‘t use the app. More and more women have been turning away from dating apps and perhaps looking for alternative ways to connect or simply checking out to heal and take care of themselves.

Dating apps already have far more male than female users and them leaving means the paying clientele (men) will eventually leave as well, hurting the apps’ bottom line. That is the only thing I can think of, in terms of a reason behind a campaign like this. Trying to shame their main ""product"" by essentially calling women who won’t use it anymore nuns and celibates to shame and lure them back into their platform. 

Even if none of the women who left are going to do 4B, there is still something in the air. Women are fed up with the current state of affairs and are finding myriad ways to process and deal with it. And many are doing 4B without even being aware there is a term or movement like this.

not just one of them, but actually both of them got divorces from my grandpas. they were both for similar reasons.

my maternal grandmother had 8 children with my grandpa and as recent immigrants (back in the 70s), they had to work twice as hard as anyone else to make a living. but my grandpa just worked his two jobs and made no time for my mom or her siblings. my grandmother went back to school while also working two jobs, then went home and cooked and cared for the kids, half of whom were toddler or baby aged. she single-handedly raised those kids herself WHILE in college with two jobs. she realized she’d had enough when he would abuse her for the house not looking good enough.

my paternal grandmother luckily only had my dad, but listened to her intuition and divorced him because he was psychologically torturing her. she is the strongest woman and such an inspiration to me. it was especially tough because they were both ultra religious, and both her parents threatened to disown her. 

however, fast forward to modern day and they are both very much thriving. my maternal grandma travels the world and is greatly supported by her kids, both financially and mentally. my paternal grandmother runs a book club she has with about 7-8 other women twice a week and she knows i’m always down for a little gossip sesh with her too.

Not saying ""excuse me"" anymore when passing by a man.  Not saying ""sorry"" for accidentally bumping a grocery cart into a man's cart in the grocery aisle.  Just moving silently, paying no mind.  

Then there's work.  Focusing on tasks at hand and ignoring male co-workers as far as possible.  When dealing with them being strictly business, no eye contact, no laughing at stupid jokes.  Turning down offers to ""grab lunch"" (again with no eye contact).  Most importantly, networking with female co-workers, lunching with them, laughing at their jokes, and openly praising their intelligence and efficiency.  

Then there's the money saved by not spending it on men or preparing for dates or paying for dates.  That money gets invested into women-owned businesses or charities for girls specifically.  Even things like dish soap, try to source from small women owned businesses.

Moving silently in the ""world of men"" while building up ""the world of women"" - imagine if just 10% of the global adult female population did this?

Already the world doesn't know what hit them with the ""declining birthrates"" and ""male loneliness epidemic"".  Media talking heads keep wringing their hands because they can't put 2 and 2 together.

- Partake vegan and gluten free chocolate chip cookies. They were delicious and saved my ass when I was starving at Target and in a rush to an appointment.

- Simple Mills cheese crackers. I can't eat gluten so I haven't had any kind of cheesy crackers in a long time, and these were super yummy. Great snack.

- my mom actually bought a bottle of Mrs. Meyer's dish soap with a huge refill jug to go with it. She didn't know it was a woman-owned company when she bought it, but I was happy to inform her, and try it out. It smells really nice and cleans the dishes just as well as Dawn soap.

greyyskyy,t2_y52l7n2nf,t3_1grdze4,,We are free,"I mean think about it for a moment, how great does it feel to be free? 

Just starting with the base of 4B ~ No dating, no birth, no sex, no marriage with men..

Look at how much freedom there is in that. You have just removed the vast majority of your problems in life & created SO MUCH SPACE for YOU. 

Isn’t that amazing? How are you filling that space? How does it feel to choose YOU? To break through the glass ceiling & finally prioritize your goals, dreams, ambitions, etc without being bogged down & having to constantly self sacrifice & minimize yourself?

How does it feel to play big? Take up space? Be unapologetic? Redefine femininity to you? 

I know we have a lot of political BS to navigate through, but this post is about your world. It’s about you as an individual.

The first step is freeing yourself. We have done that. 

Do you feel the peace? Just take a moment & disconnect from the barrage of info online… focus on you.. breathe deeply and just feel.. do you feel the weight that’s lifted off your shoulders by choosing yourself? Do you feel the expansiveness? The potential? The opportunities? 

There’s so much available to you know. 

This may not be the best analogy but it’s what I have at the moment.. I think of a Venn diagram. One circle is your life / you. The opposing one is society. Then the middle circle is how societal structures influence your day to day life for better or worse. Don’t forget your own influence, don’t forget to focus on you. 

This movement is bigger than ourselves, but don’t forget it starts with YOU. You are the epicenter of your own universe.

So, how does it feel to have given yourself permission to be free & stepped into such a powerful space? I’d love to hear your responses. 

And maybe there’s a grieving process ~ that’s OK too. Making a massive lifestyle shift is a big decision, and sometimes we have a myriad of emotions that arise. It’s also valid if the freedom you’ve created in life feels bittersweet. 

But don’t forget, that you chose yourself. And you chose to be free. 

I’m so proud of you.

And of me. 

We chose freedom. ",1731615023.0,,222,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1grdze4/we_are_free/,False

PuzzleheadedData50,t2_uto5eki8,t3_1grggp8,,Decentering.,"I was hoping I could vent a little bit. While it is easy to decenter men from my life, it’s not a quick process, and that’s okay. I’m sure some women could relate to my experience.

Personally, I grew up without a father figure, and the male figures weren’t terribly great either. For most of my life, I’ve been seeking out men and I wasn’t sure why. I’m not particularly attracted to them. Lately, I started to wonder if it wasn’t really men or a partner I was seeking, but something more like a parental figure. 

Someone who might protect me, and give me guidance, and to be there for me. I’ve felt so lost, for so much of my time. That’s what I wanted from my father and he wasn’t there. 

I just didn’t realize that may very well be what I was seeking all along and why I was always disappointed. Relationships with men were the closest I thought I could get to that, I think. This movement helped me think deeper about these things. For that, I’m grateful. 

With that realization, I can work towards that personal growth and nurture what I need in myself. I was filling an empty space with the wrong things.",1731621490.0,,128,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1grggp8/decentering/,False

Hiii I love this sub and the concept. I’ve never been with a man and have always refused when they asked me, whether they are younger, older or my age. Whether offer me money, dates or whatnot. I didn’t know there was a name for it till a few months ago.


I feel like as WOC it’s great for us to have our own space and share our experiences as they are very different from non WOC. I see a lot of American girls (I’m British) have come after the US election and WOC (aside from black men) were the only majority by such a huge margin that didn’t vote for Trump which is beautiful. <3 How could a convicted rapist win?

My GP heard my list of reasons and I met a fantastic gynaecologist on the day of my assessment and I explained I just don't see men as Domestically compatible and I like my own space and for this reason I don't ever want to become pregnant. 

I explained that my entire 20s was dedicated to rebuilding my life as a young woman after marrying young. How I would hate to take a step back and degrade myself by being confined to some kind of compromising partnership again. The women she saw my reasoning and wrote her signature I couldn't believe it. 

Here I am 3 days resting and have seen the misogynistic attacks of "" your body , my choice"" and it really affirms I've done the right thing undoubtedly.

I know that some places it is hard to access this surgery but I'm so pleased and want to say if you don't get accepted at first do not let it get you down  try and get a second opinion.

sewerbeauty,t2_4q713blw,t3_1gryqmq,,I wish I’d found this movement sooner so that I wasn’t living with so much regret. ,"I made a decision to step away from dating & sex almost 3 years ago, but have only recently found the movement. My decision to step away from sex/dating has been the easiest & most impactful decision I’ve ever made. I really value my peace & am glad to not have it disturbed by men. BUT I can’t lie, I have been *disturbing my own peace* & I want to put an end to my ruminating as it’s starting to feel like self-flagellation. Since making my commitment to no dating/no sex, I have been struggling to come to terms with the fact that I will never have a positive/enjoyable sexual experience. 

TMI, but since I ‘lost’ my virginity (zero recollection & woke up with bloody sheets) I’ve been dealing with a lot of sexual shame. I’ve had a few experiences since then where I’d conned myself into thinking that what I was doing was ‘empowering’ (spoiler alert - it wasn’t). 

I know this movement is about something beyond sex & how I personally feel about sex. However, I can’t help but feel sad that I have nothing to look back on fondly. All I have are some blacked out/hazy memories I can’t seem to access & a couple of crystal clear memories of unpleasurable times. It’s kind of depressing & I feel a little haunted by it. My sexual experiences are probably some of my deepest regrets in life. I am deeply disappointed in myself for putting myself in harms way & feel as though I’ve done permanent, & potentially irreparable, damage to my relationship with myself.  

Apologies, this probably sounds like the ramblings of a mad woman, I’m just hoping somebody may have some advice on how to move on from this level of regret. It’s less about the bad sexual experiences themselves & more about the fact that I allowed myself to be treated that way. I feel like I failed myself. I cannot fathom how I didn’t see things this clearly before. I wish I never had sex & had nothing to look back on at all to be honest.  

Is anybody else dealing with these feelings? Has anybody managed to overcome this sort of regret/guilt? Maybe I’ve lost my marbles. Would love any advice<3

ProcessMaterial3501,t2_j8efoyb0h,t3_1gs81ug,,‘casual sex’ myth,"I think a broader discussion about the illusion of mutual “casual sex” would be really productive in celibate spaces like this. You aren’t allowed to question the intention of the concept without being deemed right-wing and I think that’s pretty detrimental. My reason for despising it is inherently leftist and anti capitalist. Why support a lifestyle that conceptually and intrinsically benefits only men while encouraging the exploitation and disposal of women’s bodies? Full stop “casual sex” “fwb” and “fuck buddy” are synonymous with abuse and I’m tired of pretending it isn’t. Detach any emotional attachment to your victim and blame them for rightfully reacting negatively to being used. Women and girls are a sex product to men and dating apps are the vessel in which they shop to obtain them. There is nothing liberating about being viewed as a temporary sex object always at threat of being replaced. Men know it’s just shopping for toys; that’s why they’re furious at the concept of having a smaller pool to choose from, they feel entitled to having an unlimited variety of objects. What pleasure could a straight woman possibly get from it besides fleeting validation? Participating in it is akin to self harm.

I've seen this used in all kinds of cases. A woman who enjoyed sex with someone and someone else didn't like that. A feminist woman comes in to defend her. ""Stop slut shaming!"" How is she a slut? Do you know her, were you present for the encounter? By what metric do you judge her to be a slut?

I've even seen it used when talking about rape victims 🤡 Some dude says ""Well I mean look at how she was dressed."" Often I see loads of presumably feminist women come in with ""This reeks of slut-shaming"" Rape victims are sluts?

The worst case is using it when talking about *children.* ""I don't think there's any reason swimsuits for little girls should be SO tiny and revealing."" ""You're slut-shaming right now."" Sis that is a *child* you're talking about.

Had someone who didn't know me try to defend me once and she used this term. Sis, I appreciate you standing up for me, but I'm not a slut that's being shamed, I'm just a woman being shamed/harassed.

It's just incredible that this is done so thoughtlessly, especially by women who have *absorbed* a term used to harass women who have a lot of sex, a little bit of sex, sex with the wrong person, sex with the wrong gender, sex the wrong way, or even no sex at all. Why use that word to try and defend women? Why not just call it misogyny, or, I don't know, something more specific, misogyny based upon clothing, misogyny based upon presumed sexual activity + preferences, etc.

Just, why call a huge group of women you don't even know ""sluts""? Why use this word when trying to defend someone? ",1731733575.0,,49,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gsg19v/confused_by_feminist_women_using_the_term/,False

People keep saying that they voted for Trump because of the economy. Regardless of the truth in that, everytime I hear that statement, all I hear is that they believe their income is more important than my life. If that is the case, I want their economy to work without me. 

My idea, for me is to cut my contribution to the economy by stopping the vast majority of my discretionary spending for the next four years and then one day a month (maybe the 6th because of the whole Janusry 6th thing) make sure I contribute absolutely nothing to the economy that one day. 

The challenge with all this is figuring out how to make sure that my withdrawal does not contribute in some other way.

So if I opt not to buy something, but I leave the money in the bank.... the bank then uses that money to make loans & stuff.... which is then contributing. If on my day of noncontribution I play games on my phone & there are ads, then I have contributed by ""watching"" the ad.

Isis, aka The New Trophy Wife, is a youtuber whose content gravitates around hypergamy and manifesting your dream husband and family. She openly admires Shera Seven, the sprinkle sprinkle lady, popular for her advice on how to flirt with the patriarchy in order to use rich men for their money in the name of being ""independent"".

Isis was married to the perfect ""provider' man who was willing to invest in her even though she already has two children. Her content was encouraging women to ""know their value"" in this society and ""not give their body to bad men"", when one day, she disappeared from the Internet for 8 months. 

She comes back in a simple, unedited video saying that the man who she trusted more than anybody ABUSED her 4yo and her 2yo, describing him as a ""monster"". She would have never guessed this was coming, blinded by her love for ""prince charming"" who was ""perfect"".

Dear 4B community, the lesson here is that no matter the man you are with : attractive, unattractive, young, old, rich, poor, introvert, extrovert, religious, atheist, who will wait before marriage or not... You are NEVER safe. Something will happen whether it is the beginning or the middle of the relationship.

Holiday-Educator3074,t2_el7oeplw,t3_1gt07uq,,Now Australia,"This is one of the only articles. I’ve seen that wasn’t either condescending, derisive or dismissive of 4B.The powers that be keep trying to convince women that they should associate and procreate with these dudes. Nah, no thanks. 

“Your body, my choice” wrote the troll on a post about my mother dying. It was meant to intimidate me. Instead, it’s launched me into strategy mode, thinking through how women and their friends may build the cultural resilience to survive this neo-Trumpian era.
The slogan was coined by white supremacist, antisemitic, misogynist Nick Fuentes. It’s everywhere online. Hateful extremists of his calibre once struggled to find an audience among leprous worms. Fuentes dined with the new president-elect of the United States, Donald Trump, as recently as November 2022. This is the reality we live in now – American women directly, the rest of us by association.
They’re hunting us on the internet, these men. They always did, but Trump’s victory has encouraged more flagrant woman-hating behaviours. I presume they’re merely searching the word “feminist” or “feminists” to find targets in their angry – conspicuously vast – spare time.
They’re certainly not doing the research, because I live in Australia, where my body remains my choice, protected by suites of laws passionately defended by the people even when threatened by anti-abortion politicians. Seventy-six per cent of Australians support abortion rights, with high rates of support among men. Why the difference? Australians have no inherited Puritan fetish for suffering. Being bound forever to someone you don’t love, and paying for kids you don’t want, doesn’t much set you up for a happy and satisfying life.
Our American cousins who’ve had the same realisation, alas, are now at the legal mercy of those who haven’t, won’t, and tend to ban any books that suggest they ever will. But even as an Australian, it’s hard not to feel an encroaching global darkness when Trump’s proposed defence secretary is the latest man to freak out about catching girl germs from female combat soldiers, while in Russia, Trump pal Vladimir Putin is banning “childfree propaganda” supposedly to arrest declining birthrate. The Russian parliamentary lower house voted unanimously this week to punish individuals or entities who promote the terrifying feminist ideology of maybe not wanting kids. One suspects Vlad’s lads would get more of a demographic bounce by not feeding soldiers into the meat grinder of invading Ukraine – an estimated 700,000 casualties to date – but if there’s one thing we’ve learned about population policy anywhere, it’s always easier to blame women than for one second take a hard look at yourself.
‘No man will touch me until I have my rights back’: why is the 4B movement going viral after Trump’s win?
So I absolutely get why there’s sudden TikTok interest in the radical Korean feminist “4B” doctrine, where – to avoid the “your body, my choice” gender hatred and the inevitable cruelty that such hatred mobilises – women reject dating, sex, marriage and children and remove themselves as much as possible from mixed-gender social view. In an America where women are bleeding out in carparks due to anti-abortion restrictions on medical care, politicians are agitating to end no-fault divorce, alleged sex offenders are seen as dating gurus and, you know, Trump has just been elected president, let’s be fair – going near anything that could get you pregnant now suggests not the fun possibility of thrills but clear and present danger. Sure, sex is great … but have you ever considered spending 5.4 minutes of your day on something that doesn’t carry lethal risk?
Those 5.4 minutes are perhaps better temporarily invested in how they may navigate away from the place where immediate choice over their body is most likely to be taken away – and that’s intimate, domestic environments. Yes, even in sunny Australia, almost 70% of sexual assaults by men of women occur in a residential location. And while Australians don’t have the same political limits to our freedom as women do in Russia or America, we have an intimate-partner violence problem informed by the gendered hatreds that manifest in other cultures, in other ways. November has been a brutal month here; 11 women were killed in a period of 16 days.
Does maximising self-protection have to mean eschewing men and sex completely and joining 4B? No, of course not… but it does mean, perversely, heeding the Putinist recognition of the power of cultural persuasion – blocking the messages, fighting attempts at social coercion and building safer relationships. As individuals, in friendship groups, in families, in communities, we must resist the thousands of years of aggressive romance narratives that overwhelm stories for and about women, encouraging us to pursue “true love” and the attainment of partnered relationships (and, crucially, social witness to them) as the apogee of female social triumph.
What keeps girls most safe from the abuser with the “your body, my choice” worldview is a strong group of female friends, independent living and a driver’s licence. These are the attainments we should encourage everywhere, with the message that when you’ve got them, you’re ready for a relationship, and men who don’t respect them paste a red flag on themselves.
The discourse around intimate partner violence in this country and elsewhere has ever been “why didn’t she leave?”. In this tense and fragile time for women, it’s on those who still see women and girls as human beings to consider just what we all did to push her into danger in the first place.

Electrical_Cell_8797,t2_y7yuremg0,t3_1gt7254,,Recognizing the Right to Non-Motherhood in a Pronatalist World,"Being that one of the tenents of 4B is no childbirth, I think it's safe to assume a decent portion of this sub do not have children and do not plan on having children. That being said, I think as childfree women, it's critical to discuss the various penalties we face from society and how we can circumvent them.

Taking a quote from the article:

""This culture of assumed motherhood has allowed pronatalist policies and rhetoric to pervade our everyday lives, often rooting women’s value in both their capacity and decision to reproduce. The non-mother is othered, becoming a deviant simply via her existence and exertion of human rights.""

Personally, I think the childfree community overlooks this reality.

""Globally, there are countless pronatalist policies: tax incentives, cash benefits, and family-friendly employment options for those who have one or more children. The choice to have children is incentivized and rewarded. Beyond material benefits, it is culturally celebrated.""


I'm interested in hearing the thoughts from other childfree 4B women about this. What are your strategies for securing financial independence as a childfree woman? How do you plan to build community in a world that discards women without children?

ComprehensiveHat8073,t2_ti7sx6yj,t3_1gtg6io,,How We Look,"Men frequently complain about how women look in public.  ""Blue Haired Land Whale"" is an internet meme created by men who bemoan the lack of their beauty standards being upheld.  When they go out and about they want to have eye candy to look at in the streets and public spaces.  

My question is: should we purposely go against the ""beauty standard"" in whatever country we live and intentionally make ourselves unattractive to them, even if we personally prefer to groom, dress and adorn ourselves in a manner that is considered conventionally ""attractive""?

Personally some of my tastes are in line with what is considered conventionally attractive.  On the other hand I don't like that some men may be getting personal satisfaction or dopamine boosts by seeing me in a pretty dress with my hair well done.  

I've started intentionally dressing down, going without makeup and purposely messing up my hair when I go out for errand running or even for meet-ups with girlfriends.  I've seen a lot of complaints by men about sweat pants and hoodies online so I started wearing those outside.  My preference would be to not wear these things but I don't want to please men's eyes.  

This seems to be a catch 22.

I want to make the world uncomfortable and unappealing to them as much as they've made it for us.  Although I personally love pretty clothes and jewelry, it seems that they do too - on us.  They lament the passing away of a culture where women were always well groomed and put together in public, even if poor (so they say).   I want them to keep lamenting that and feeling that their eyes have no soft place to land anymore.

Debating the boys in class, arguing with the pro-life protesters on my university campus, replying to comments on TikTok and Twitter and Reddit and YouTube... and I'm done. It's a major stressor to me, feeling like I have to argue with everyone, and I'm done. I'm exhausted. I keep making replies and deleting them after because I don't even want to hear what these people respond to me with.

I keep thinking, ""What's the point?"" These men want attention, and they shouldn't get it from us. They can get it from the many like-minded men who vocally agree with them. The only voices that would get through to them are the voices of other, reasonable men, and any arguments coming at them from women will usually be ignored. There's just no point to it. They crave women's attention as much as they hate women, so by responding to them, it's just giving them what they want.

I was inspired by the Twitter user that didn't respond to the man telling them ""your body, my choice."" They just reported him. That was the moment that it clicked for me. If there's an action to take, then take it. If there's a threat to you, report it. Otherwise, don't acknowledge them. They're just trying to provoke. This realization has been very freeing to me. I no longer feel burdened to respond to every comment I see. Report the nasty ones, then move on. It's not our responsibility to try to educate them or change their minds. I'm done with it.

Curvy-Insect,t2_miupd7c5,t3_1gu421d,,Any socialist/communist women around here? ,"How do you reconcile the fact that often what the movement asks us is disproportional to what it gives us without giving up?

What I mean is often women are treated the same as men when it comes to fighting or industrialization efforts but then we don't get the same positions of power as males do. Most leaders of former socialist nations are men. Even though women could have positions of power (for example first woman to go to space was Russian) we were still not taken as serious 

(on the example of Valentina Tereshkova, she still serves on the Russian parliment and voted pro invasion of Ukraine unfortunately) 

Furthermore in some cases women rights clashed with the common good. In Romania, Ceauscescu banned abortion and conditioned women to their roles of bearing babies by saying that was necessary for the common good (the dude was a bit crazy but still) 

It saddens me that there's no political ideology we can turn to.

WellThatsFantasmic,t2_3pm3k511,t3_1guz7ir,,Vasectomies and manipulation ,"Was scrolling through my main page today and saw a post on r/USNewsHub that was talking about us. Men were mentioning that in order to continue having sex, they could just get vasectomies and that several were already scheduled. The guy had the gall to imply that the movement was just a spectrum and that no one would take it seriously and commit to all 4b’s.


DO NOT FALL FOR THIS TRAP.


1. Who is going to fact check them? There are so many ways to fake documents, call up buddies to pretend to be doctors, lie outright, etc. Unless you witness the procedure yourself, you cannot verify that it has been done to the penis that enters your body. (Not to mention that sometimes they fail and that they can be undone).


2. It’s just another way for men to skirt around women’s issues and get what they want. It’s manipulative and dirty and doesn’t take responsibility for the pain and suffering that women experience everyday.


3. The 4b movement is quiet and powerful. These men are floundering HARD. They are SCARED. They are going to try everything in their power to get us in their beds. They’re going to start with sweet words, love bombing, promises of love and kindness, apologizing, and then it will get ugly. STAY STRONG AND STAY QUIET.


Any further information and/or words of encouragement are much appreciated. I just wanted to get the word out there that the sneaky little shits are already trying to worm their ways into our pants.


Edit to add: I’m not condemning the act of getting a vasectomy. If allied men or AMAB want to do this to “help” us women, fine. Just know that it’s not enough. You all have a voice that is more powerful than ours, so use it to actually do some real good instead of doing something for your own benefit and then saying it’s for everyone’s. Do more than the little bit for your own pleasure, or for your own conscience.


Also, for the married women who are commenting that their husbands are getting snipped and are so proud of them, good on you! I’m glad you’re proud of your hubby! But remember, the majority of us still see him for who he is: a man. To us, he is no more trustworthy than the next guy. Just because he is married to you does not make him any less capable of rape, sexual abuse, or other terrible misdeeds. BTK was happily married with kids for YEARS before he was caught. Ted Bundy walked Ann Rule to her car several times because he didn’t want creeps to hurt her in the dark. Men (and women) are capable of hiding their true natures from you. Have empathy for your fellow women and understand that you are already not living the 4b movement.",1732028693.0,,551,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1guz7ir/vasectomies_and_manipulation/,False
Adventurous-Steak525,t2_lvk5ib1z,t3_1gv0vqa,,Been a participant for a while.  Just now realizing it ,"I’ve stopped centering men for a while. I haven’t dated in four years since my last abusive relationship (someone who would reveal himself to be a supporter of the 45th). Realized I was aro and actually hate romance. Stopped going to any place that would sexualize me. Stopped talking to men who normalized sexist ideas. Kinda stopped talking to men altogether. Found a job in a female dominated field where I only have to interact w about three men a day. 

Most of this was unintentional. I’d find other justifications for my life choices (ie: I want to work on myself rather than spend energy on a man). Truth is, I’d never felt safer, more emotionally stable, more motivated to work on my own passions. With every round of men or male spaces cut, I was slowly regaining a confidence I haven’t had since I was maybe 14. 

I’ll even occasionally think to myself “men aren’t so bad. I’ve only had a handful of bad experiences in the past four years”, and then remember that’s about how long I’ve been avoiding men and why I chose to avoid them in the first place. 

My opinion and trust in men vastly increases when I’m not forced to be around them. My “misandry”, as people might call it, flares when I’m forced to be around very manipulative men who have no respect for my personhood and boundaries. I feel like there’s a correlation there.

eeeves,t2_2uogmp1f,t3_1gv4zbj,,how to join - my thoughts,"I saw a few posts asking how to join, so I wanted to share my opinions. The movement is about changing your lifestyle to prioritize yourself and de-center men, no need to meet up or subscribe to anything. 

In addition to the 4Bs, here are my thoughts:

Live your life as you like it without the consideration of mens feelings. Look and dress how you like, without pressure to look good/sexualize yourself. Do not make yourself a target by boasting about taking part in 4B-but at the same time do not be afraid to speak your mind and set boundaries, especially with men you choose to keep in your life (family members, those who are already in relationships with men, etc.) do not tolerate disrespect. Do not give men your time. Take care of yourself! Invest in your health, finances, and happiness long term. Build relationships and community with other women in your life. Be conscious of who you are supporting; only buy from women owned businesses, consume media not made my cis straight men, etc. Protect yourself! Take self defense classes and purchase a weapon if you are comfortable/able. Read feminist literature, especially by women of color. 

Not sure if this counts as derailing, but I wanted to add some thoughts for my fellow women in the US: we are all terrified and disgusted by post roe America and project 2025. Be informed about the coming legislation that will affect you. Protect yourself and stay quiet, or write to your local government officials. If you live in a red state and don’t plan on leaving, read up on how to take care of your health at home since you cannot rely on the healthcare system. I listed some books that may be helpful. 

Some books:

• Leadership Recreated: A Woman’s Guide to Surviving and Thriving in Patriarchal Academia by Kem Gambrell (Great guide to decentering men, can be applied to other aspects of your life not just school)

• The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan

• New Handbook for a Post-Roe America by Robin Marty

• Natural Liberty: Rediscovering Self-Induced Abortion Methods

• Wildseed Feminism

• Hot Pants: Do it Yourself Gynecology and Herbal Remedies by Isabelle Gauthier 

• Invisible Women by Criado Perez 

• Against White Feminism by Rafia Zakaria

• Why Men Love Bitches by Sherry Argov

• Bad Feminist - Essays - by Roxane Gay

• You or Someone you Love by Hannah Matthews 

To reiterate, these are suggestions/my opinions and are not required to be a part of 4B. Follow the 4Bs and live your life as you see fit ❤️ Please feel free to share more books or discuss additional or alternative advice.

TheShowLover,t2_7ujg79xe,t3_1gv7815,,"A reminder that 4B will be a rousing success even if not all women participate. In fact, it's already been successful for years in the US","**4B, in a sense, has long already taken root in the US** 

Right now there are numerous incels in 2024 who would have been married in 1980. There is also a so-called ""loneliness epidemic"" among men. 

Think of all the women that have already been saved from all sorts of horrors because of these developments.

**But we must prepare for the information war**

There will never be a 100% participation rate. And that's okay. Don't let this discourage you. 

The other side is going to downplay 4B or doubt it's effectiveness. They'll highlight and celebrate women getting married and having kids (oh look Taylor Swift is engaged). Once again, pushing the notion that less than 100% participation equals failure.

They'll say 4B in Korea is niche yet somehow the movement is famous worldwide. And the birthrate is dropping there because of other factors. Blah blah blah. 

All this just to discourage you.

But this is just them panicking because they see what it'd been like so far and now it's going to get worse.

There are incels and lonely men *right now* before the launch of a conscious 4B movement. Imagine when it really takes off.

EDIT - I initially decided against adding the following for the sake of brevity but looks like I'll have to.

Acknowledging that men exist is not centering them.

Noting the effect 4B has on them is not centering them.

Centering means making their problems and issues the focus.

I personally don't care if men ever have sex again. At the very same time, that would be a sign of 4B's success and hence worthy of note and celebration.",1732048511.0,,826,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gv7815/a_reminder_that_4b_will_be_a_rousing_success_even/,False

RemarkableReindeer5,t2_414opfqn,t3_1gvvtho,,Men Feel Entitled to Women’s Spaces: A Rant,"Current university student (for context). Our school gym has women’s only hours daily where only women and women identified folx can exercise in peace (and actually get to use the weight room) and the staff are women. It’s literally an hour and a half each day. Today, I’m using the weight room ; which is just below our running track so the runners can see inside so it’s off limits during these hours. The two guys come in and start running around the track with 30 minutes left of Women’s only hours. The female staff approaches them and one had the decency to leave while the other continues running, ignoring the staff. He also proceeds to ogle the girls working out in the weight room. 

When I first started at this school, the ENTIRE facility was off limits during women’s hours and was staffed entirely by women. It was nice b/c the hijabi girlies could walk from training area without having to cover up. Now it’s just the weight room and the track that are off limits and even then men still feel entitled. It’s an hour and a half; same time every week and they still pull this bullshit. 

I never really liked or paid attention to menfolk before but the most recent us election has me avoiding them even more. I can count on one hand the number of men I genuinely like and respect (it’s three). Men don’t want women to have their own spaces and just exist and it really grinds my gears.

I feel like I've taken my body back, like I can just live for myself now instead of being seen as a baby maker for men. It's done! It's over! I know that I've never wanted kids and never wanted to be pregnant, and I feel so empowered.

I'll never bleed out in a parking lot. I'll never be torn apart by a baby coming out of me. Pregnancy and birth can never be forced on me.

As for the surgery itself, it was very easy. I had it done yesterday by a wonderful doctor. The incisions were very small. I was feeling bloated yesterday, but today is much better and I'm only a little sore. Having your tubes removed, rather than just tied, reduces your risk of ovarian cancer by 80%! Another added bonus. Also, this way, its permanent. No more hormonal pills, no more painful IUD insertions.

Anyways I'm just over the moon and I didnt have to pay a CENT for it!! I am employed and my insurance paid for it completely. Im so happy, I would recommend it to any woman who is certain they don't want kids and is planning to be 4B for life.

BriefPeak7196,t2_vhd9xgft,t3_1gw0ysy,,small rant on instacart & men’s incompetence ,"I hope i’m not being the A hole here but things like this are truly annoying. I am finishing up at a long day at work. I work in a human services career and go to school full time online finishing a degree in trauma. This program and the life that flourished through it has shown me A LOT about humanity and men and society and “how things are”. I’m having small wine night tonight with a girlfriend who needs some extra support and a friend. I didn’t have time this week or today in between work and school to go grab us a frozen pizza and grab some extra things for myself for the rest of the week and that’s where instacart comes in clutch. I’ve always been weary of it because of the conversation surrounding men using women’s profiles and the dangers of answering the door when you live alone etc etc so i always do no contact. 

My first issue i want to address is the fact that I have a very serious chronic pain condition that is limiting and when I use instacart, it’s meant to help people like me, yet i have seen a lot of resistance from some people who are drivers who don’t want to finish the job and come up to the top floor and set my groceries at my door, it’s as if it’s an extra chore that deserves an extra tip which is really shitty. 

I also understand that I am someone who hates grocery shopping, it overheats me and gives me anxiety and it’s a lot on my body so in times like these, instacart comes in clutch. I hide my profile picture and have clear, concise, written instructions on how to use the call box and how to use the elevator to get to me. So why I’m here? 

The pictures attached outline my frustration in what seems like a common occurrence of weaponized incompetence. Do I have to spell it out for you or can you use common sense and just pick another bag of plain bagels? Why are you texting me a picture with no context, what do you need? You don’t need my permission and a text exchange to pick a bag of plain bagels and i’m not there and mildly busy. Do you need guidance? i don’t get it. That’s asking extra steps of me when you can just make the decision. 

What is it? Is it laziness to even type out your messages much less type a message at all or spell out the word ‘okay’? WORK WITH ME not against me. I can’t stand this shit because then every time I turn around everything from my looks to my knowledge to my competence and the work I leave behind is scrutinized down to the detail and while this may seem so minor, it’s annoying and reinforces that men don’t have to try. At all. In any job even the easiest one. 

AITA? Because this seems like it’s really not that hard. I see men doing this everyday, all the time. In every area of their lives. It’s only giving an inch when you are gifted with being able to offer a mile, no skin off your back and then it’s criticizing the other party because they had to cover you and give two miles and you’re just fine with it. You’re chillin. Not even an afterthought. 

I don’t normally even get bread, i just wanted some plain bagels 🙄 

I know our jobs/expectations are different but this brings me to the front door of a conversation surrounding gender, expectation, emotional labor. I am peacefully 4b and have been for a while, so where do we draw the line of not giving a mouse a cookie? Because either way, I have to be the one to say something, lead the conversation, ask questions and tell someone what to do, essentially. Then I become the bitch for having a tone or not responding. You can’t even choose silence. Men criticize women so hard on everything and when we bite back or correct them it’s just more of an excuse for them to resent us and call us names or worse case scenario resort to violence. I don’t want to have to coddle people especially the male gender on a daily basis. You are not my child, please get it together. How do I pick my battles on this represented by a very minor example and has anyone else noticed/experienced this especially while being a part of this movement?

Adventurous-Steak525,t2_lvk5ib1z,t3_1gw1m6c,,Men are staring at me a lot more post election ,"Ever since the election, I feel like I’ve been stared at so much more than usual. I live in nyc so eye contact is not something you just do with strangers. If you accidentally make eye contact, you look away quickly or make an awkward smile and move on. This is different. I’ll catch a man staring and he’ll keep watching me as we pass on the street. On the subway I’ll catch a guy staring, look away for a while, and realize he’s still staring a few moments later. This has happened a few times a day for two weeks. 

This will sound a little contradictory, but I’ve also felt like men have been nicer than usual. Sometimes in a good way (I think some men are just being empathetic to all the misogyny going on online rn), but sometimes it’s almost too much? Like their infantilizing me, over-answering questions and what not. It weirdly scares me in a similar way that the staring does. I’ve had a lot of nice guys turn out to be not so nice and I wonder if I’m picking up on something subconsciously. 

I’m curious if anyone else has experienced this or if it’s just all in my head. In another post I made recently, I talked about how I’d unintentionally been decentering/avoiding men for a while, so there’s a chance I’m just more aware of men in my space post election. I’ve never actually, truly been afraid of men until now. They’re staring at me and I’m thinking right back “if you had a chance, if we weren’t in public, would I be in danger?”

Asleep_Song_2253,t2_efiasan6,t3_1gweery,,One more proof that anonymity is the secret sauce,"Lots of people on this sub have been talking about the US lately but I haven’t seen anyone mention that Russia has recently banned any content that “promotes a conscious refusal to have children”from the public. I guess it’s because mainstream Western media still sees Eastern Europe and the Middle East as those “barbaric”, less societally developed parts of the world. I’ve seen reporters on Western TV call themselves feminist and then say something like “go to Iran where these views are normal”. Rest assured, these news are as much of a shock and abnormality to young women in Russia, as they would be for women in the US.

Anyway, the reason I’m sharing this is to provide more evidence that women’s withdrawal from childbearing and marriage is such a powerful tool and such a prevalent phenomena all over the world that there now are European governments that outwardly ban any mentions of it from their public eye. While many people are reasonably upset by this, I see this as a sign that these trends are stronger than any pro-life propaganda governments spew on television. And also, as a confirmation that sharing information underground is a much more effective strategy in the long term than screaming into the mainstream void. 
Any woman in Russia rn would be much better off joining 4B quietly instead of committing visible acts of resistance 

I was wondering what’s the situation like in other non Western countries? I’m not from Russia myself and in my Eastern European country, the government heavily leans into “positive” patriotism to guilt trip people away from becoming economic migrants and having children abroad.

ging-ernation,t2_19rw976wcs,t3_1gwjfjc,,My hair has been brushed exactly 0 times,"I read a post in a popular men’s subreddit today asking if your partner asked you to do something mundane, like peeling an orange, would you? Big shock, all the men are offended at it being some psychological mind trick and they’d never give into these “games”. As if doing something little for a partner without getting anything in return is so awful. 

“Every task has a reason and there should be a goal.” … this is how men see being in a relationship. Like how it’s always, every backrub must lead to sex for them. God forbid you give a backrub without a goal for your personal gain.

I have done this in dating my whole life. I will directly tell a man that since I have very long hair, I would really love and appreciate him occasionally helping me brush it, when he sees me doing it. It’s hard to reach the ends and hurts my arm and it’s also just very lovely to have someone else do it for me. I then never bring it up again. A task that has no reward or goal besides being a good partner to me. 

I’m not asking them to learn to braid or brush it daily. But show me a selfless act of love that helps me and it’s a desire I openly communicate. Requires very little effort and makes me feel loved. But not once has a man ever helped me. 

I love helping my partners relax or lighten their burdens if I can. No more. You know what I did? I got a puppy and swore off dating. Sure a puppy won’t brush my hair, but they also won’t pull it during sex and force my neck where they want it , or drag me up the stairs by it, or judge the quality of my existence based on its color. 

I’m going to continue being a loving human who cares for those she’s with by peeling oranges, brushing hair or cooking dinners, but now for my sweet adoring dog who loves me unconditionally back

corydoragirlie,t2_t1xb0hlpm,t3_1gwwdnf,,The story of how I ended up in this community ,"So, I have been definitely through the ringer when it comes to horrible relationships. My first boyfriend was very abusive and manipulative which I didn't realize until a year in and it was really hard for me to finally leave. The second was equally as manipulative which I also, didn't realise until a year in and was hard to leave. Then I was single for a year and built up my selfworth but deeply depressed. I hesitantly entered the dating world again, casually. I wasn't really planning on getting into a serious relationship at all but when I met him, my most recent ex (spoilers), we clicked and moved really fast. He wanted to see me everyday and I ended up falling deeply in love. He was the kind of person that would just let me ramble on for hours about nonsense and never make me feel like he wasn't listening. He was like my best friend. And then our anniversary came around... 

I told him that I get nervous at this point in relationships because I feel like something is going to go wrong and he reassured me. He told me he had similar worries because of past relationships but that nothing was going to go wrong. Then, a couple weeks later I went to google something on his phone and he wouldn't let me and joked that he didn't want me to see the weird hentai he watched (which was weird because we were open to eachother about that kind of thing). So I got that gut feeling to look at his phone when he was sleeping. 

I not only found weird shit he was watching but I also found he was subbed to like 3 girls on OF and messaged one ""I've always wanted to fuck you so bad"" AND that he looked up prostitutes in our area. I was heart broken on a different level. I found things on both my exes phones before and I never thought this would happen with him. I genuinely had no doubts at all. But he was doing that the whole relationship. Needless to say, I woke him up and kicked him out. 

I wish I could say it ended there but I let him talk me into giving him another chance. He said that he had an addiction and was alone for a long time before he met me and said that he had a problem with porn since childhood. I empathized alot with him and wanted to make it work but I was deeply insecure now about our relationship. I almost thought of doing fucking couple's counciling before 3 months later, I found shit on his phone again. I had made it clear to him that I didn't care if he watched ""porn"" per say. I watch it too, but messaging people, going on a deep dive on specific ppl""s nudes, and stuff like that I was not ok with. When he went into the store that day, I saw his phone and couldn't help it. Come to find out he looked up a specific girl's nudes (like a 100 pic deep dive) THE MORNING AFTER I had just gotten comfortable enough to send him nudes of myself. That hurt so badly. That almost hurt worse than the first time. 

I wish that I had listened to his actions and the words he said to that OF bot, lol. Not to mention he would sometimes talk about how OF creators are harmful to men and he doesn't like them YET  he clearly did. Also it's funny that I would disagree and he argued with me about it. That is so typical honeslty to shame and dehumanize the women who you jerk off to. I will never ignore the signs. But yet again fuck that. I'm not wasting another year of my life. I'm going to travel, work, and pour into myself and my interests. ",1732239663.0,,81,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gwwdnf/the_story_of_how_i_ended_up_in_this_community/,False
taxidermiedmermaid,t2_e0wo2oy0x,t3_1gx18f0,,Is anyone else so traumatized they can’t handle it anymore?,"TW SA

This is a vent so I’m sorry if it’s not ok here. But if anyone has a similar experience I’d love some thoughts.

I’ve been sexually assaulted by men my whole life. It started with my dad, and a boy in preschool as well. Then it was several exes in high school, including my first boyfriend, who was 30 when I was 15 and was extremely violent. Then it was a few more guys from 19-21. Sometimes it’s been sexual assault and other times rape. None of this was even in a weird situation. Like, I had an interview for a bar at 19 and the 50 yo interviewer ended up assaulting me in his car when he said he had to get forms. Or I hung out with a guy at 18 and he brought his friend over without my knowledge and they raped me. Or I had a friends with benefits for a year who started holding me down when I’d tell him to stop. There were others but those were the types of situations usually. I’ve also always attracted the very aggressive, horrible guys in daily life and have just been harassed, cornered etc so much I couldn’t take it anymore. I was a waitress from 16-22 so anyone who has been knows the harassment is fucking insane. I quit so many places because I couldn’t stop being cornered or groped or treated like a sex worker. I had insane PTSD and a man speaking to me in public would make me numb for 15 minutes.

Then, COVID hit after I graduated high school and I started wearing a mask. I also stopped being around men, ever. So for the most part, except for at work, men left me alone, because I wore a mask. The few times I went to a bar, I was still bothered, and I always seem to attract the rapists. Like once, a guy followed me into a bathroom stall after I rejected him all night, luckily my friend saw it and banged on the door. Then, I went to a bar this Halloween, I tried to get my very drunk friend home, this guy who had seemed decent all night said he’d drive her home with me there so I was like whatever bc the uber back to her place was really expensive, but when I came back down from putting her to bed and expected to go home, he wouldn’t let me out of the car even though I kept refusing and he literally basically kidnapped?? me and took me to his apartment. Nothing happened to my knowledge, I was pretty drunk and fell asleep. I asked him if anything happened and he said no but I woke up to him cuddling me so who knows. I don’t think anything happened though

And now, ever since the election, my mask is irrelevant. I live in an extremely blue state and I only go into work 1-2 times a week bc I work from home mostly, and every time I go in I get bothered. Every day a guy bangs into me from behind and then doesn’t even pass me just wanted to hit me, physically assaults/gropes me, harasses me on the metro, whatever. Just tonight I went to the grocery store and got in the elevator going up to it, and an employee cornered me in the elevator when I kept trying to get away and was saying a bunch of weird shit, I had to literally almost run to get away from him when the doors opened. I know none of this is that bad anymore but my trauma has made it so that every interaction like this sticks with me for several days, even though I’ve gone to years of therapy.

I don’t understand why men *fucking hate me* and why the violent ones love to harass me. I know they harass all women but I seem to attract exclusively the rapists even in public. I actually cannot do it anymore. I believed that it was over and the worst of it was done around COVID bc of the mask and all that. But it feels like I’m back in high school. I already tried to commit suicide at 18 bc of this and when I went to the mental hospital, the middle aged men there harassed me endlessly, talking about me so explicitly, it was just awful. Nobody cared. And afterwards one tried to threaten me with suicide to get me to his room which he rented near my dorm. I’m not suicidal so don’t report me. But I almost can’t go outside anymore at this point.

Sorry for the trauma dump. But I just can’t do it. I can’t be harassed or raped anymore. I literally just can’t go outside anymore. I assume they bother me bc they detect some sort of vulnerability bc of being a victim previously, but I did EMDR for two years and they still bother me constantly. It’s not like I’m timid or don’t say no—I’m a very confrontational person and I always said no clearly and it doesn’t fucking matter

I haven’t really interacted with men outside of work in 3 years. I had two male friends I’ve had for 7 years and they’re long distance bc we knew each other before college  so I don’t have to be alone with them. So I’m not worried about that sort of thing. I only really have women in my life. But they don’t leave me the fuck alone in public.

Does anyone have a similar experience? Or advice? Anything? I’m so broken. I’ve gone to therapy for two years and was doing way better and then the election came about and now they’re all so violent and aggressive and rapey.

Edit: thank you so much to all of your beautiful comments. It’s so amazing to hear from only women. I appreciate your support so much. Also, I feel like I came across as saying this only happens to me, I didn’t mean that, I only believe it’s unusual because my mom and previous therapists always act like I must do something to cause this bc of the amount, and I just interact with men so much less than the average woman and yet every time I go out something happens, etc. It just feels like my entire life has been the time between various rapes",1732255568.0,,203,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gx18f0/is_anyone_else_so_traumatized_they_cant_handle_it/,False
They_Live_Nada,t2_1c61ztm7fk,t3_1gx26jh,,I feel like the blinders are off.,"I think I've been living in the matrix for the last 59 years.  I don't know how I discovered 4B or this thread, but it's been a life-changing, eye-opening experience.  

TV shows I once enjoyed are no longer funny.  Virtually every show or movie depicts a woman as needing rescuing, being pursued, dominated, abused, objectified, less than, or in the role of domestic servant / trapped mom.

I find myself sizing up very man I encounter.  Listening to every word out of their mouths for sexist remarks, off-color ""jokes"", or entitlement requests. I'm watching every physical movement for signs of intimidation, aggression or attempts to minimize me. I'm watching strangers in public to see how they interact with other women. 

I now see them for the pretenders and predators they are.

I realized that I've been putting up with my husband. Not loving him. Not enjoying him. Just tolerating him.  I've been trading financial security for peace of mind for almost a decade.  I thought being married to a big ""protector"" alpha male would make me feel safe, but I feel like I'm on-guard constantly.  

I can barely stand to look at him now that I SEE him.  

Having been born in the 1960's, I was raised on the ""white picket fence, happily ever after"" fairy tale.  I thought I just hadn't married the right man with my first husband and I let myself be gaslighted into marrying this, my second husband.  I feel so let down by the women in my family, my mother and grandmothers could/should have warned me what marriage was like, but it was not something their generation did.

I'm working on my exit strategy. I'm retired, so financially it will be a nightmare, but I'm determined.

To anyone else that wants to escape a marriage or relationship, make your plan quietly, stealthily, and with determination. Don't talk about it to anyone.  Your married friends might tell their husbands and they might warn yours. Build a war chest even if it has to come $10 at a time from the grocery bill.  

Much love and gratitude for all of you for giving me strength!

I first met him at an on-site team builder. My first one with the company. Later at my tool, which is next to his, we got to talking.  First about semi, but then about his travels and hobbies. He has been in semi for years and with our company for a long time, as well. Our corporate culture places great importance on building relationships with mentorship potential, so I kept things friendly, despite some misgivings.

One misgiving I had was that he seemed to chat mostly with the young women working on the floor. Now, I'm no spring chicken, but I'm not quite to my ""last day of fuckability."" One of my work acquaintances specifically seemed to always sit on the far side of her tool when she had to operate it and he was around. I'd see them talking and her laughing politely, so I didn't ask her about it. Every time I ran into him around the office or cleanrooms, he was always chit-chatting with a younger or young woman. 

One night, I asked him about his home life because usually when I see a man behaving the way he does, it's a prelude to an extramarital affair. Without much prodding, he told me that his wife had gone full Q-Anon since the pandemic. It was to the point that they could barely converse in a civil manner, but he was too broke to divorce. Pobrecito...

He would often stride up, even if I had my headphones on and wasn't wanting to chat, just expecting me to break attention for him. If I relented, he would talk to me until it was time to check on his tool, or until someone else came by to talk to him about something. I was simply more interesting than a cell phone, and he wasn't tired enough to nap. 

I had to take a little space from Jeff before the election after he said something unbearably ignorant about abortion (Jeff is a cisgendered pro-life man with no children of his own). Still though, I put pressure on myself to extend the olive branch, because be the change and we're in a civil society, and all that good liberal shit. I even got him to start watching a television show I'd been obsessing over. Keeping it real surface, but keeping it friendly.

I am training on a new tool which is in another floor entirely, so I saw him much less. Like clockwork after the election, Jeff reached out on Teams to say that he missed talking to me and missed seeing me. I chatted a little bit about the show, but eventually I sent him a video of a young woman doing impressions of her German mother insulting her (lau ramoso). He had lived in Berlin for several years. He said the harsh tone of the woman triggered him. I don't know why it was the straw, but it was. I called him a snowflake. It was over company teams chat, but IDK, something about him looking to me for emotional support after all of it, pissed me the fuck off.

Sometimes when I see discourse around 4B, particularly around trolls and around how to decenter when men when one has already done one of the B's (gotten married, reproduced) I think of Jeff, my unpaid labor, and my ignored discernment. 

Not all men are rapists and murderers. Not all men abuse their partners.

But ***all men*** are poisoned with patriarchy. All men, because they live and grew up under a system which tells them female energy and attenuation is a *given*, will react with resistance when women begin to pull that energy back. 

I never touched, nor do I have any desire to touch, this man's peen. And yet, the unpaid labors of his wife and female relatives and friends wasn't enough. He needed the added hit of female attention at work. 

Sex sells and patriarchy justifies itself on the basis of sex. So I don't blame anyone new to this movement or just decentering men for thinking ""not all men"" as a knee jerk. Or even ""they can't all be that bad."" But, question for my rational queens. Why are we trying to find a slice of edible bread on a moldy loaf? 

Ask yourself, as some of you head home for the holidays to organize, cook, entertain, and attenuate to your loved ones on your days off. Why is this work left to you? Ask yourself if you are someone who is ""like a sister"" or ""one of the guys"" what kind of unpaid labor you are doing under these auspices and why? Is this a true friend, or is this someone without the ability to make quality male friends or in between relationships using your feminine energy? Is this someone using you as cover to gaslight or outright deceive other women into consenting to levels of contact with them, that they wouldn't otherwise allow?

I know this is long, but I share it to widen the way we think about and assign value to our time, energy and resources. The patriarchy wants us to think that we need it, when it's really the other way around. It needs us believing that our only power is through sexuality, and that isn't the case either.

No_Sport_2354,t2_11se5q1q2o,t3_1gxcgrw,,How to develop confidence in male dominated professional and academic settings ,"So for context I (18F) had  very religious and conservative upbringing where girls were always expected to be quiet and obedient while boys were allowed to be loud and socialize however they wanted. My (all girls) school was so strict that even being seen with a boy outside of school can lead you in trouble. (One of my “friends” got caught with her brother in a bus by a teacher who assumed he was her boyfriend. She almost got suspended. I wish i was kidding).

I started university recently and something I can’t help but notice is how confident the boys are when giving presentations, asking questions etc while the girls are more reluctant. Some male professors’ kind of sexist attitude when teaching does not help.  For example we had a chemistry practical session yesterday and every time a girl would do a mistake he would always make a really degrading insulting joke in my native language about how women are stupid and not good at practical skills. 

Being a very quiet and introverted person has definitely not helped my case. I’m not sure if I’m being over sensitive but I somehow feel like I don’t belong there and I’ve been dealing with some imposter syndrome. I would really appreciate some advice from women who have been there in my place on how to be more self confident in environments like these.

They cannot possibly grasp that it could possibly be centered around the individual woman’s self-protection and independence, and not about taking away their romantic and sexual gratification. It’s also quite telling, that most men seem to solely focus on the consequences that follow regarding casual sex because of the 4B movement, which indicates how they truly view women.

We're never going to be safe around our oppressors and they know it.,"I recently came across the Laken Riley murder case and it's reaffirmed how women will never be safe in mixed sex societies. Laken was murdered while on a run. She took all the typical precautions women are told to do things such as going through a populated path in broad daylight while sharing her location with friends yet she was still murdered by a man who was ""hunting for females"". It's not the clothing, time of day, etc; it's how women & girls are forced to live around ruthless predators with no defense. It's how dehumanisation of women & girls is rampant and goes unpunished until it's too late. It isn't womens actions that are the problem but that they have to be around those that hate them. Most of the advice people give around female safety is bs, notice how it's not generally suggested to remove the common denominator? People rarely ever say ""we need women only avenues/services"" or ""go to a woman only park/bar/nightclub etc"". If anything when these spaces are set up they get shut down. Women only spaces & services are never a popular talking point because that's the only solution that would drastically reduce abuse but societies are set up for women to be abused. [Women only spaces only supported when they benefit men](https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/s/6Itph11IU2). If Laken was in a woman only park then this wont have happened as with many cases. 

I've seen a couple posts here of women speaking about abuse they've been through at the hands of men with some even blaming themselves but it's not their fault. Women are forced to be around misogynists, we're not allowed to fight back, the perpetrators rarely get punished, yet people blame women for being abused. I know 4B is personal but the personal is political. We all know the value womens labour brings to society and starving society of that will crumble it.
- No dating or marrying only to be used as a shock absorber of violence as partners take their frustration of the day out on us while maintaining a positive image in society. No offering them labour as they pretend to be superior & we're inferior.
- No sex that leads to a similar situation as the above (saw some maIes talk about how they use sex to release frustration).
- No birthing kids that will only end up perpetrating violence or being a victim to such cruel violence.

Having to take so much levels of precautions to be safe as a woman is asinine & defeats the purpose of being in a society, what's the point when we're not protected? They will try their best to intimidate us. They'll come at us physically, emotionally, and financially but more women are seeing how it's a rigged losing game & they're violent either way so are simply not willing to play anymore.

I guess force is his idea of ""encouragement"".

But I've been thinking, what if the government were to pay women to have children.  Buy pay I mean provide them with homes in areas they want to live, give them a salary, medical and dental insurance, guaranteed retirement pension, everything, for the rest of their lives.

The women would be artificially inseminated so no need for male ""partners"" at all.  They would also be provided with live-in or live-out nannies, also paid by the government, so the entire burden of child-raising wouldn't fall solely on their shoulders.

With medical innovation there might be a way to ensure only female babies get born.

All of them are so antisocial today already, if women put a full stop on online attention everywhere, it would have a massive impact, since our world is so involved online today. Would it be possible to start an female only space where men can’t insert themselves?

There’s not a single app online that isn’t that.
 
Any time I go on instagram and scroll through comments it’s CONSTANT “expired, damaged goods, single mothers are for pumping and dumping only, don’t be a simp (any time someone treats a woman like a human being) etc etc etc.” or some new story about rape, murder, harassment, men getting away with doing the most vile thing without punishment. It’s on the daily. I’m so fking tired of it. And I’m so tired of the gaslighting, “not all men” whenever you bring up any complaint but at the same time seeing floods of this type of shit on a daily with more men all piling onto the verbal abuse in droves in these comment sections, never standing up against it. It’s like they make it into some sort of fun competition among themselves, who can disrespect women more creatively, like it’s become their favorite sport. Men don’t deserve women. I think the best thing to do is give them total silence and completely remove our presence. Let them starve completely. Watch how quickly their ass starts itching when they have no outlet for all the abuse.

worldsbestlasagna,t2_3v2zdtfq,t3_1gy6wn3,,Question on newest of this,"Just wondering, is this something people here are just now doing because this is how I've been pretty much my whole life. I remember in high school in 2001 thinking if we just didn't date shitty guys then they'd have to change. 

I did try to date a bit and honestly have no trouble getting dates (I'm conventionally attractive, not a 10 but around a 7)  but after they realized I wasn't going to put out right away or do emotional labor then it ended. And sure I've had sex and found it underwhelming. 

I don't cook, I don't clean, I don't to unpaid emotional labor. I'm honestly fine living like this. I never had a goal to get married. Sure, when I was a kid I thought it'd just happen but my effort was always into academics and my job. And I will say I do have some wonderful male friends, both older (75) and younger (20) then me but that pretty much where it ends. 

I guess I'm asking because it seems all of the 4 things listed in this are things you'd have to try and put effort into having. It's like if people made a goal to not travel to other countries, not parasail, not ride a horse, and not drag race. Those are all things people don't do on a daily basis anyway and you have to go out of your way to do them. It's not like it's not eating meat, drinking only water, running 5 miles a day, ect.

Maybe it's just me but people/I don't just wake up one day and find themselves married with 3 kids.",1732388151.0,,50,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gy6wn3/question_on_newest_of_this/,False

Simple_Basket_8224,t2_d5xj6vkh,t3_1gy8rxf,,Friendships with men are what radicalized me the most. ,"They showed me that men do not care about you as a human. 

I’ve had many male friendships as a girl. All of them I’ve lost after the men realized I’d never return their romantic feelings (that they kept hidden from me). Mysteriously, I also lost many after getting in a romantic relationship and being happy about it. Coincidence? All these “friends” turned on me and became rude, joking constantly at my expense, making sexual remarks. 

The ONE male friend I had for years and years that did not do this, I just dropped. Why? Because I excused shitty behavior from him for YEARS because “he’s just a man”. Constantly, I’d be there for him. I supported him and never judged him. I’d talk to him on the phone and comfort him when he was extremely suicidal. I’d always ask about what he’s up to, how his family is, wish him a happy birthday. I was always consistent from day one. He on the other hand would rarely offer any emotional support. Wouldn’t care to learn about what I’m up to. Would often say I’m just “taking things too seriously” when I’d be upset about objectively difficult things. When we would talk, he would monologue for over 30 minutes straight and then zone out the moment I’d talk. I cut it off finally just a couple weeks ago when I shared with him some music I loved and he just said made a joke at my expense and didn’t even bother to learn about it or listen. I’ve never had any problems like this with my female friends? Why TF is it so hard for them? To act like they care? To be a friend in the most basic level?

bebe8383bebe,t2_h5jxsknjh,t3_1gydsb3,,They can’t help themselves,"I am prepping my home (rental) for a kitten I am getting for myself in a few weeks. 

I can’t get security screens installed on the windows, so I am constructing my own safety guard (I’m paranoid she might accidentally jump out of the window).

I’m walking home from the bus carrying these two big sheets of metal mesh, and suddenly this guy (50’s) who is walking his dog tries to stop me and asks “what have you got there?”… um, none of your business, stranger. I was confused - I was “in my own world”, minding my own business and mentally trying to figure out my next steps. I just said “huh? Oh, mesh” and didn’t stop (I don’t owe him a conversation or explanation). As I walked off I heard something like “that was rude, just trying to be nice”. I was so blown away - what goes through these guys minds?! How about you pay attention to the dog you’re walking and leave me alone. Did he actually expect me to stop and explain my project to him?! I think he must get used to women paying attention to his dog and therefore him, whereas I completely ignored him.

I guess I look too feminine to be able to do any handiwork, huh?!  I am great at fixing and making things - far better than any of my ex’s who 1) threw money at someone else to fix things, 2) attempt to fix it and break it (or decide it’s too hard - usually a tantrum involved), or 3) slap it together with no care, just to say it was done (so they could go back to playing video games). 

I usually just ignore men (the past few years), but I’ve been paying more attention to what they do around women - they always want a reaction! They expect women to always smile at them to acknowledge their male presence like it’s a gift. I’m not talking about basic politeness - I’m not hostile unless it’s warranted. But they will do anything to get a woman to look at them.

This is during a conversation that had nothing to do with relationships/sex/women. It lives in his mind rent free. He understands the power of it. He doesn't live in Korea and works abroad but still recognises the power of it.

But you know what I haven’t seen much of? Men talking openly about how they can work to make the US a safer and more equitable country for women. There have been a few guys expressing sadness but understanding that more women feel like avoidance may be better. Beyond that, it’s absolute crickets. 

Whether or not individual women embrace 4B is their own business.

4bamerica,t2_1cfgot8mch,t3_1gyt23n,,How Motherhood Keeps Women Trapped,"Motherhood is something that’s often glorified in society, but for me, it’s also a reminder of how the patriarchy keeps women trapped. It’s not just about raising children—it’s about how women are *expected* to raise children, often at the expense of our own well-being, time, and autonomy. We’re pressured to endure the physical and emotional toll of pregnancy and childbirth, all while society pushes the idea that motherhood is the ultimate goal for women. But what they don't tell you is that, in many ways, motherhood takes away your ability to live freely. You’re expected to be the emotional caretaker, the housekeeper, the cook—and all of this work is undervalued and unpaid. It isolates you, keeps you too busy, too tired, and too overwhelmed to fight against the oppressive systems that benefit from your exhaustion.

I think the worst part is how motherhood becomes an emotional trap. We’re expected to love our children so selflessly, and that’s beautiful, but it often turns into a cycle where you prioritize everyone else’s needs over your own. You’re so caught up in the daily grind of child-rearing that you forget who you are outside of that role. And the worst part? Even when you want to break free, it’s hard to escape the economic and emotional dependencies that keep you stuck in unhealthy situations. The system pushes women into these roles, and it’s so hard to imagine life outside of it.

I’m not saying that motherhood is inherently bad. Mothers are some of the hardest-working people I know. But what I *am* saying is that the system that pressures women into it, without recognizing the costs, is flawed. We need to support women in making choices that are free from the societal chains of motherhood. Women who don’t want kids shouldn’t be shamed—they should be celebrated. Let’s stop idealizing motherhood as the be-all, end-all, and start recognizing it for what it often is: a tool that the patriarchy uses to keep us busy, exhausted, and isolated. We deserve better than that. We deserve freedom. ♀",1732460969.0,,768,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gyt23n/how_motherhood_keeps_women_trapped/,False

r/SingleAndHappy is good for me because it helps me be more content being alone and accepting that having a partner won’t magically make me feel content or less lonely. Oftentimes, I find myself feeling *more* lonely in a relationship bc my (hypothetical) bf just doesn’t care about me on the same level I care about him, to put it as succinctly as possible. I’m sure y’all know what I’m talking about. Take yourself on dates!

Plus you don’t have to worry about if he’s going to be weird with the waitstaff at your favorite restaurant and don’t have to be uncomfortable when he’s acting like a petulant child because he said “yea we can go there” when he actually didn’t want to go and can’t even try to enjoy himself or at least act right and not ruin it for you when going somewhere that he didn’t pick! 

r/TrollXChromosomes for coping with humor. All the posts are hilariously so right and so relatable. It’s hard to explain memes you gotta see it for yourself. 

r/WitchesVsPatriarchy for those spiritually inclined. 

r/TwoXPreppers for preparing for the worst (plus it’s just good to learn emergency preparedness anyways). 

r/AuntieNetwork for if you need reproductive care that is unavailable in your state. 

r/childfree has a list of OBGYNs (and other doctors) on their sidebar that are more willing to sterilize/not dismissive. The list is extensive. I found my OB on there and I love her!

robotatomica,t2_am03a,t3_1gz80dg,,I was not prepared..,"I have been practicing 4B for a while now, since before it started to take off globally post US election. 

And so I don’t think I was prepared for how many *women* and specifically ones identifying as *feminists*, were going to pile on as enemies of the movement. 

It’s not most, but **basically what I am seeing is married and partnered women, a surprising number of them show open contempt for the movement and neg it at every turn.**

Obviously not most married women, as there are a ton of married women in this sub who are allies, and show great love and support. 

But it seems like what is happening is that some women who *cannot* participate bc they are happily married, or women who don’t want to give up dating/hope for partnership, (or people who are partnered with men who are part of the problem) they’re rankled that this does not center them and they feel like the movement calls them out for not doing enough. 

I continually hear that this movement is leaving those women out when they want to be helping/joining with other women. I hear things like “abortion rights affect me too!”

Which, no one denies it! But you can’t practice 4B if you’re married and planning more children to boot..I mean, then, in what meaningful way are you denying your labor and support to men? 

I don’t think most women practicing 4B are judging these women, but because they *feel* judged, and because it makes them judge *themselves*, they are just as likely to shit on us as the dudes who are real mad at us right now. 

This has been my experience over the past couple weeks, a major change in my experience of practicing 4B. 

It didn’t use to be *women* fighting us and misrepresenting the movement and saying it’s doomed to fail, not the women who theoretically share my damn values and goals!

hassiesassy,t2_5zwiipos,t3_1gzd53c,,So many benefits ,"I’ve unknowingly been doing the 4B since July. I’ve noticed so many benefits on my physical, mental and emotional health 

I lost about 9 lbs since July. I know people say you lose weight after a break up, but I think it’s because my cortisol levels are lower. I don’t have a man stressing me out all the time. I allocate all the energy I gave to my ex bf/dating and now I redirect it to eating healthier, working out, and sleeping better. 

My emotional health and mental health have never been better. I’m happier and spending time with my friends and family. I have a good support system and it feels good being around them. I get to nurture non romantic relationships that are more meaningful, reciprocated, and supportive. Since I’ve lost some weight, my clothes fit better and people have noticed. Definitely a boost to my confidence. I’ve picked up hobbies and  enjoy hand made gifts to people. I am a proud plant mom and enjoy my homegrown jalapeños. Energy well spent. 

In conclusion, I’m doing great and going forward in life in a positive direction. I don’t want a man to mess up my progress. The thought of trying to start a conversation with a potential romantic partner makes me anxious. The thought of going on an awkward first date and getting ready gives me GI discomfort.

greyyskyy,t2_y52l7n2nf,t3_1gztp0n,,Always remember this,"Always remember to prioritize yourself, your peace, goals, mental health, life, ambitions, etc..

Remember to let go of the trauma and the past anyway you can ~ and give yourself the peace you truly deserve. 

Don’t allow yourself to be haunted by the actions of others or even your own.

Don’t allow your life force to be siphoned from you.

I visited my parents recently, and long story short I see my “father” about twice a year, tolerate him & usually get into a disagreement of the sorts. I tolerate it for the two times a year I see my mother. 

Basically, my sperm donor I will refer to as ‘S’ (hes biological but I will never call him a father) recently had a health scare that made him develop a concept empathy at 64 years old. 

For most my life he was an alcoholic and extremely abusive to my mother & I. She’s chosen to stay with him, even at my expense & I’ve supported myself since I was quite young.

Anyway, he sat me down & shared he’s been sober now for 4 years & wanted to have a better relationship with me. No apologies, no accountability, nothing. He’s now “changed with age” and he’s been sober. 

Then, he said this… “Luckily I didn’t ruin my life with alcohol. It could have been so much worse, im really glad your mom stayed with me & I have my life back”

You’re right S. YOU didn’t ruin YOUR life with YOUR ABUSE. 

You ruined my entire childhood. 

You ruined and wasted my mom’s life. 

Men never destroy their own lives. Remember, they will destroy yours. 

Then they will deny it ever happened, leaving you with a lifetime of trauma to work through. 

I refuse to spend my entire life unraveling trauma. I refuse to have sleepless nights replaying the past and allowing it to dictate my future and how I view myself or others.

I refuse to give him so much power or even be bothered by his blatant cognitive dissonance.

I refuse to bear this heavy, heavy cross that I have for so long.

Always remember it is only YOU who suffers, not the perpetrators. So don’t allow it to continue. 

I know it’s hard, sometimes fees impossible to let go of the past, but it isn’t forgiveness. It isn’t weakness. It’s strength to free yourself from the cage, from the shackles and the weight of pain.

And always remember that’s what men represent. Shackles, pain and cages.

You have chosen to reclaim your life just as I have, and here we are. Here we fucking are together, rising as one. Just don’t forget to love you in the process & release the burdens. Don’t forget to shed old skins as we all step into this new paradigm together.

No more sleepless nights, no more flashbacks, no more internalized pain or limitations, no more.

We carve out our own fate. We create the spaces we deserve and desire.",1732568308.0,,151,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1gztp0n/always_remember_this/,False

Yes, all of them. Extended, close family, literally all of them.

Friends prioritize their family, which makes sense because they have loving relationships with them. I would do the same if I could. This has made me give so much to people who can’t give the same back, partly because I prioritize our connection and give TOO much. Then I feel hurt when they don’t give back as much, but i try to remind myself that they actually have families.

I just feel like this road is pretty lonely. Are all the connections to come superficial? Is this just what I have to get used to? I don’t know.. it’s kind of heartbreaking.

1. A lot of people will not support me of I bring my assaulter to court. I've always known and joked about this, with people being like 'you should take him to jail.' But Trump is our president, matt gaetz, people are still defending an OBVIOUS piece of shit like conor McGregor, Johnny Depp... The person who assaulted me is a well liked white father amd tech professional, and I'm a black woman, no one would give a flying fuck.

2. Women's rights: I'm genuinely scared, I feel so stupid to be scared, but everyone, everyone is getting away with rape. So many, too many high up there cases and hardly any of them in jail, and the average American man thinks most women make false accusations. It fills me with so much anger honestly. I remember a post on r/mensrights debating how marital rape was never 'legal' and how women should just expect to give sex if their married and living on theor husbands dime. I talkd to my male friends about this and they'd say it's bad but try to rationalize it first and I'm just???

scoutydouty,t2_2nfs6jxx,t3_1h0d7vo,,Jobs that limit interactions with men,"I had an idea to post some job ideas that limit or have almost nothing to do with the interactions with men, whether they are bosses, coworkers, or clients/customers. There are not many, and feel free to add some more ideas below. Some of these are not tenable for long term careers, but I know a lot of younger women are here who might benefit from these ideas as they work minimum wage, or are in school still.

Payment rankings: $- low paying $$- semi-livable wage $$$- well-paid, especially with expertise

I'll start with what I do:

Gig work! Self-employed contractor work such as:

Rover- petsitting/dog walking app. You can choose your clients, set your own schedule, and set your rates. $-$$

DoorDash/GrubHub- deliver food. You are alone during this job, and you have the option to unassign orders if you see a male name, although this can affect your completion rate, one of the metrics by which DD sends you good paying orders. $

Instacart- shop and deliver groceries. Similar to Doordash, and from my experience mostly women order from Instacart. $

Other work:

Data entry- can be done from home alone, requires some training. $$

Virtual Assistant - can be done from home alone, can be picky about clients if you can break in to the field well. $$

Transcriber- logging dialogue from videos and audio recordings. Can be done alone at home. $-$$

Personal Trainer/gym/yoga/self defense instructor- requires education and certification, but you can absolutely cater to female clients. $$$

Overnight custodian- gyms and schools are the best bets, you usually work alone, but you may have a male boss. $

Overnight security guard- same deal as custodian. May have to actually deal with male violence as required by job, but usually you just watch the cameras and call the cops if you actually see anything suspicious or criminal and they deal with it. $-$$

Beauty industry- nail/eyelash tech, makeup artist, hair dresser, wedding dress shop, etc. Some require education, training and certification but most of your interactions will be with women. $-$$$

Feel free to add more ideas! I omitted traditionally female-led jobs such as social work, nursing, education, and vet care, due to a high probability of dealing with nasty men. However, that doesn't speak to my feelings about these incredibly necessary and important jobs. This list is more for the women like me who are extremely uncomfortable being around men in any capacity.",1732631538.0,,87,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1h0d7vo/jobs_that_limit_interactions_with_men/,False

NavissEtpmocia,t2_6dp4id,t3_1h0lxb1,,Beguines - the medieval female separatists,"Hello everyone,

In the Middle Ages, in the 12th century, there was a group of Christian laywomen who lived in semi-monastic communities in medieval Europe, called the [Beguines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beguines_and_Beghards). You have to bear that everyone was religious at the time, but it does not mean one could not be badass.

To be a Beguine means one would decide to stay single AND YET they would not enter a religious order following a rule and all. They'd join their own community of Beguines, so only women responding to no one but the other women of the community. They would not have to give up their possessions like nuns did. Actually they could leave whenever they wanted - unlike nuns, Beguines did not take formal vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. They lived in community, but remained free to leave and marry at any time.

Beguines were obviously praying but also doing charity, service to the poor, and would as well do intellectual pursuits, such as mysticism, theology and literature.

The Church did NOT like them at all, because they were not a pope-approved order. Just random women who'd choose not to interact with men, not to marry, and to do their own stuff with other women in their own communities. This autonomy was seen as a threat to traditional religious structures and the authority of the Church. Beguines managed their own affairs, governed themselves, and supported themselves through various trades and crafts, such as lace-making, weaving, nursing.

Some Beguines were accused of heresy, particularly those who wrote about themes such as the possibility of sinless perfection, the importance of inner spiritual life, and the role of women in the Church. The most famous example is Marguerite Porete, who was burned at the stake in 1310 for her writings on these topics - [I've posted something](https://www.reddit.com/r/WOMENEUROPEANHISTORY/comments/1h0llqk/if_youre_interested_in_medieval_history_and_women/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) about her in r/WOMENEUROPEANHISTORY.",1732652967.0,,205,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1h0lxb1/beguines_the_medieval_female_separatists/,False

Today I had a guy try and talk to me and I just said ""no thank you"" and walked away quickly. He chased me down the isle to tell me that I'm not his type. I was so confused. I just wanted him to leave me alone. I wasn't feeling well and I didn't feel like dealing with whatever he felt he was entitled to from me. 

Yesterday I had a guy stand by my car while I tied down a large piece of plywood to the roof of my small car. He just kept trying to give me advice despite me saying over and over that I've done it many times before and I'm good.

I don't appreciate when male employees won't leave me alone after I say no. Or random men who are customers feel the need to ask me questions or give me advice after I've said ""no thank you"".

I just wish I was invisible so I could do the things I want to without being bothered. 

A side note, I've never had a women do this. The most I will get after my ""no thank you"" is ""ok let me know if you need anything"".

PsychNeurd2,t2_71z46tqu,t3_1h1a9u9,,Woman of the Week,"Hallo! We don't officially have a woman of the week on this sub, but I read about this amazing woman last night and wanted to share.



I read a few different sources about her and this is what I gathered:

 **Theodora of the Byzantine Empire (Born \~500, died 548 AD)**

She started life in poverty and became an unwilling child prostitute with her sister to support her family after her father died.

Later in life, a guy fell in love with her and changed the laws in order to marry her (noble men weren't allowed to marry women of her background), then the guy became Emperor.

Once in power, she was the main ruler and put in laws to prevent forced prostitution, closed brothels, saved women from brothels and placed then into safe living situations, and gave them enough money to never have to go back into prostitution. She would also purchase female slaves and free them, again giving them places to live and enough money to actually take care of themselves.

She abolished the death penalty for women who cheated and changed the laws so women could divorce their husbands.

She made rape a crime punishable by death, and the rapist's assets moved to his victim after his execution.

She also was rude as FUCK to men of status who came to appeal to her, making them wait for days in small rooms and, if she decided to see them at all, made them get on the floor to kiss the soles of her feet. Even then she sometimes didn’t even let them ask about the shit they came to ask her about and would send them away instead. Imagine doing this to to Vance, Trump, or Elon 😂

During an uprising, the Emperor and his counsel wanted to flee. She was super badass and convinced the king and his counsel not to run, basically saying, I’d rather die an Empress than live in hiding. They ended up keeping their Empire. 

After her death, the emperor barely passed any laws which really underlines that she was the person in charge. He kept her female safety laws in place and continued to expand on women’s rights.

She also became a saint! Now I'm no catholic but I think I will be celebrating this amazing woman every Nov 14th!



**Note:** If you look her up on her own, be aware that a lot of her history was written by men, and the main account of her life was written by a man who didn't like her rule. I ALWAYS assume a negative light has been set on any powerful woman in history by the men who wrote about her.",1732729844.0,,191,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1h1a9u9/woman_of_the_week/,False

saembrosaem,t2_12df9h7qqp,t3_1h1cybn,,I feel like men are far more evil than society admits and women all live in mass delusion,"There's so much sadistic unimaginable evil and violence that happens across the globe on a daily basis, all perpetrated by the human male. After this whole butterball turkey debacle I've gone on a rabbit hole online about animal abuse. There's so many videos out there on how animals are treated in commercial farms, helpless innocent animals getting tortured just for their sadistic pleasure. They're not doing it because the job demands pushing these animals around for the sake of making the work easier, no these demons spend hours every day purely tormenting these helpless things for fun.

Most men today are wearing masks. And I do believe it's most, if not all men. They all have it in them. I believe the only times we see men seeming ""neutral and harmless"" are situations we're it doesn't benefit these men in that moment societally to be violent and evil. But if you look throughout many points in history, the human male has shown to have the capacity to do great evil. They will get in GROUPS and commit evil together. It's one thing when one man does something fucked behind the scenes that he thinks he's getting away with because no one is there to see and shame him, but to get together in groups and do vile shit together is on a whole other level of diabolical. This is something you will never see women do. But men do this all the time. They have the ability to get together and make agreements to gang rape and torture as a group.

When they are able to get away with evil without any repercussions, they show us they all have it in them. I often think about that recent incident in India where 80 men raped that woman who was a doctor and not one man stood up and said, ""hey guys maybe this is wrong, maybe we should stop"".  Or other stories in history like the witch trials or the rape of nanking when an entire Japanese army of men raped and brutally tortured up to 80,000 (estimated) Chinese women. All the men participated. All the men today in the middle east are participating in their culture that doesn't permit women to show themselves, or in some parts even speak. The level of dehumanization that these men inflict, I cannot comprehend it. What makes them think they are entitled to take a woman's freedom to just live her life on that kind of level? She's not even allowed to speak. She has to cover herself head to toe, she's not allowed to show herself, to even exist as the living breathing creature that she is on this planet...


I think for a lot of women, to truly see the face of men, mask completely of, it's too painful and disturbing, so we willingly tell ourselves something that's easier, something that makes us more comfortable. Because what really is the reality for women if we chose not to participate in the social contract with men? It's either willingly agree to be a sex toy and loyal slave to a man for the rest of your life and still be treated like shit and abused or, try to separate from men all together and be met with violence and mass brutality.  

I don't think the social contact was ever built on mutual love, care and respect anyway, I think the contact was built on women agreeing to care and basically worship men just so they don't torment us. It was never a reciprocal agreement. If you think about it, everything about it that makes perfect sense. I see women protect men in  society far more than I see men protect women. Look at how divided women are right now after the election. I have seen a mass influx of misogynist women who I guess think that if they help men abuse women they will gain some sort of favor? Idk

Men talk about us in the most disgusting ways when they're alone with their buddies. They make it a fun competition among each other on who can disrespect and degrade a women in a more creative fucked up way. I genuinely believe abusing women is their favorite sport. Look at porn, look at what they masterbate to for pleasure. It's all women's pain, degradation and humiliation. And they watch this shit on a daily basis. Porn gets three times the traffic that several other major platforms get combined, like YouTube, instagram, Facebook and a few others I believe. And the majority of porn is just vile. This is who men are. Yet women refuse to see this. 

And social conditioning doesn't help of course, men do everything in their power to convince us WE are the evil ones. The more oppressed we are the more they claim we're privileged. All their religions they create demonize women and treat us like we're dirty. We need to ""submit"" and a woman who doesn't submit, a woman who behaves like a man is deemed evil and deserves punishment. We're not allowed to talk about how truly terrible it all is. Society shames women for ""hating"" men a lot more than it does men for hating women. When men talk about their mental health everyone stops what they're doing and pays attention but a woman's mental health is used to abuse her further.  Woman are constantly told that their traumatized, have daddy issues, are damaged goods as an insult just to further degrade and shame her. But poor poor men are told to ""man up"". This conditions women not to complain at all. Because the difficulties women face vs what men face which is simply ""I cannot get my dick wet"" is NOT the same at all. But we are not allowed to talk about this. 

I wish we could form female only societies where we can separate ourselves from men all together and start coming to terms with what reality really is. If you think about it, women don't have freedom at all. They created the government and they use us just to enslave and breed. They created a world where we have no choice but to give ourselves to them and their rules. I think women truly thrive and are happiest when we have good circles of girlfriends. I would love to grow old with a good group of friends far more than growing old with a man. 

I really wish we could some how in secret get away from them all together.",1732736440.0,,1040,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1h1cybn/i_feel_like_men_are_far_more_evil_than_society/,False

I have been 4B for 2 years, with one exception — I’m a “spy”. I pretend to be a “cool friend” just to extract truth about my male friends. And my god, men can’t wait to tell me how much they hate women. I have heard all excuses under the sun — “she’s crazy”, “I don’t feel anything for her”, “I just don’t know what to do”. A friend of mine dumped his girlfriend of 5 years because I gave him bare minimum attention and now he believes he’s the most attractive guy on Earth.

You know the worst part? They are bros to each other. They guide each other on how to get away with it. How to cover up their mistakes and cheating, how to hide chats and bank statements. They encourage other “happily in a relationship/married” men to stray, they tempt by showing them hot women they can access and all the s*x they can have. FREEDOM is their selling point. 

There’s nothing that will ever convince me to date a man. Right-wing women think they won when they got picked, but their boyfriends are in my DMs, spilling secrets on how much they hate them. They will say absolutely anything to me to get in my pants, including hating on the ladies who built them up. 

Don’t come at me, I only collect information and have never reciprocate interest. I’m not interested in destroying a fellow woman’s relationship and happiness, if you can even call it that. I’m sharing all my secrets with you ladies in hopes of dissuading you from giving into men’s lies.

Not sure if anyone else follows celebjets, trumpjet, etc., but 2 days ago Mark Zuckerberg made a private visit to Mar-a-Lago. ""Mark Zuckerberg has been very clear about his desire to be a supporter of and a participant in this change that we're seeing all around America, all around the world with this reform movement that Donald Trump is leading” was a quote from a statement Meta released confirming the meeting. 

Now I know it’s not news that billionaires are pieces of sh*t, but what IS important to note is that not only is Elon’s Twitter not a safe place for our personal data, but I believe we should be extremely skeptical of anything Meta (threads, FB, ig)
Be careful who you follow, what groups you’re active in, and what type of content you engage with. We just have no idea what’s going to happen, but we do have a precedent for the type of behavior that we are starting to see, and it’s dark. 

I think it’s safe (as of now) to carry on with 4B/feminist/childfree discourse here on Reddit, as well as discord, BlueSky, and TikTok. 
Some may argue TikTok isn’t, but for now I believe it’s ok. Even though the government wants to shut it down and/or force a US sale, to me that says they don’t like it because they cannot access it and don’t have control over the content. 
(I do know that Peter Thiel, JD Vance’s billionaire sugar daddy and creator of PayPal has been a major player in attempting to force the sale of TT to a US-based tech company, and I believe if that is successful he would be first in line to acquire it, which at that point would make it an unsafe platform for free speech.)

kissiemoose,t2_5b51kqae,t3_1h3eci2,,4B Thought Work,"A funny thing about the human mind is when you tell it to not think about something - it struggles to think about anything else 😂. So as we try to do the thought work to break the habits of centering men  in our lives we may be indirectly creating the habit of thinking about them more 🤦‍♀️. 

If this happens the first thing to remind yourself is that you are not your thoughts you are the being watching your thoughts and you do have a choice in what you choose to think. 

Then ask yourself, by focusing on this, what am I avoiding? What feelings am I trying to escape (or numb from)? Women are socialized to put others before themselves (ie. Codependency) so if I catch myself worrying about others problems- it is often a way to avoid my own problems 😬.

If you find you are not avoiding anything you just want to change your thoughts, when you catch yourself thinking thoughts you don’t want, it is good to make a plan on what you Do want to be thinking about and use those moments to remind yourself. 

For me, I am using that time to read Eckhart Tolle’s The Power of Now in order to break free of the egoic mode of consciousness. It is this collective egoic mind of patriarchal societies that have got us where we are today. The only way to make lasting change first begins with our thoughts which in turn will lead to behaviors that model for others a different way of living.

Midnightchickover,t2_3n23bq8y,t3_1h3juhf,,I feel a lot of men who complain about the gender wars or the anti-rhetoric that happens against men are often ignorant about the actuality of the gender wars as the violence is primarily happening towards women.,"I often feel like men amongst MGTOW, red pill, manosphere, and incel communities obviously argue how men are oppressed or treated unfairly across the board, though it's mostly misleading and not nearly as disproportionate as they tout. I expect that from them.

Though, on the other token, you'll have men and even sometimes women who say that the gender divide is perpetuated more on social media or in the mass media than in reality.  I'm not criticizing the middle ground party as much as they often formulate an opinion and belief that creates an artificial middle ground/centrist spot to lazily accommodate both sides.

With or without disregard to the gender wars, that cis het men create much more violence against women than any other group.  Women aren't committing the same level of overall violence in public, private, or intimate environments. Again, it's not to say that women don't engage in violence, because they do, but it's not to same level as men. Women don't commit the same type of violence against other women nearly as much as men do to women and most of all ... other men, especially out group men.


I think when people cry about the gender wars, there's a validity to it, but I often wonder do they understand or underestimate the systemic attacks against the rights of women and girls versus men & boys.  Men often feel invalidated and abused from not being to engage in performative masculinity or getting the same benefits as their forefathers did when it came to conduct or control with women.


Oftentimes, for women, it's only an exercise of basic rights and courtesy that is afforded to everyone else. 

It's like the middle ground doesn't also consider that the same or similar groups of men also perpetuate violence against men of different classes, ethnicities, and  anyone within LGBTQIA+ groups. I highlighted the last group, specifically because the group with most resistance and violence against said group is still cis het men who are also likely to be against general rights of women and are believers in a more hierarchical society.

It's an irrational assessment to have a centrist position between two sides, where one wants all and total control/alienation and the other wants its fundamental right and freedom to exist. The only way I've seen this conceptualize with a reasonable outcome is in far-right spaces and politics.

You say it's a war on gender identity and traditional masculinity/femininity, yet the people on the side sexual minorities and the people of variant gender identities have not threatened violence en masse against traditional establishments that support traditional gender roles.

I say this as a caveat to we don't normally see women threatening traditional spaces of masculinity and conforming to male habits and vices with violence, death threats, mass-shooting, rape, etc. The incident rates are nearly to mostly nonexistent.   Men are able to conduct themselves as freely as possible within the confines of traditional masculinity unless they are confronted by another male for whatever reason. That's the main scenario that is likely to affect most men (cishet men). Just like everyone else.

I wrote an article a while back with an experimental model showing how men who do nothing while witnessing harm actually benefit the most from ongoing oppression.

	•	100 men are represented by light blue dots that darken with increasing privilege.
	•	100 women are represented by pink dots that turn red with increasing harm.
	•	The men are split into two groups: 10 active perpetrators and 90 passive bystanders.
	•	Active perpetrators (10%) commit extreme violence against women at fixed intervals.
	•	As the active men inflict harm, the passive men’s privilege grows, shown by their dots darkening over time. The more they stay inactive, the more power they gain.
>• The 10% active perpetrators do not *gain* significant privilege in comparison and often *lose* privilege over time 

This model shows that passive men aren’t innocent—they are the key enforcers of patriarchy, inheriting privilege without facing consequences. Their silence isn’t inaction; It Is Action.

Ok-Trade-6716,t2_gc7d27k7,t3_1h3tnew,,Depressed & Feeling Alone,"A woman who grew up in the South and in a heavily Christian family. Had a lot of internalized misogyny/bad ideals growing up when parroting family members, before getting into the arts and meeting some wonderful people from all walks of life, which helped me grow out of the toxic mindset that had been entrenched in me all my life. Went to college and got a degree, but now I’m kind of floundering and don’t know what to do from here.

I’ve had persistent depression and introversion most of my life. With a structure it’s usually manageable, but now I just feel lost in how to get my life started from here. After the death of my only family female role mode, I had no other options but to move in with my two male relatives at the time as a teenager before college. They don’t know/are ambivalent about helping me navigate this beginning step of my life after my degree and out in the ‘real world’, expecting me to just figure it out myself. And I don’t know, maybe I should, but it just feels all so overwhelming.

I don’t really hate men. I love my male family members (at least the ones I live with, I’d like to think). But ever since recent political events, it’s made me take a hard look at them and recognize where they seem to lack a certain level of empathy that makes it feel exhausting trying to explain my feelings as not just a woman, but also with mental health issues.

I’ve heard of the 4B movement and heard it is not just for decentralization of men, but also of helping uplift women in their lives. I guess this might seem a little desperate, but I suppose I just was helplessly trying to throw a line out into the ether of this women’s Reddit group to search for other women who might’ve been in a depressive hole similar to my situation and perhaps some vague mentorship advice to point me in the right direction of women’s centers/groups that may be of help for me here mentorship wise in how to begin starting out in a career?

I know it probably seems ridiculous to those who don’t understand depression, but I just can’t seem to get things on the right track myself. Usually once I have a structure, I can get the wheels turning no problem.

I hope this post still fits in with the topic of the movement. It has definitely inspired me some. I am also planning to get sterilized myself, not just because I should have the right to my own bodily autonomy, but also because I’m under no illusion that I could care for a child, much less with the mental condition I’m in right now.",1733022300.0,,12,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1h3tnew/depressed_feeling_alone/,False
They_Live_Nada,t2_1c61ztm7fk,t3_1h3tnkh,,Anyone beefing up their food stockpiles?,"I spent Thanksgiving day dehydrating power greens and canning meals in a jar.   I've gone down a rabbit hole in the last few months that started with making my own bread, which then led to binge watching youtube videos on food preservation.  It seems most of the content creators I came across also do canning, dehydrating, and are ""doomsday"" prepping / stockpiling for when ""SHTF"".  Click. Click. Click and the next thing I know, I'm ordering a new pressure canner and dehydrator.  I grew up canning, shucking corn, and storing things in the cellar of my grandparents' farm.  I just needed to brush up my skills and read the latest food safety guidelines.

The majority of the ""prepper"" information out there is male created content, but if you seek, you will find females. I also took the time to click the ""don't suggest channel"" for any male content creators that popped up.  

Don't overlook the USDA and your local county coop extension for information on emergency preparedness and safe food preservation practices. As a word of caution, don't rely on anyone, male or female, that is not following safe practices no matter how many followers they might have. Just because someone's grandma always did something, doesn't mean it's safe (known as ""rebel canners"").  The USDA has test kitchens in a lot of universities. Their guide to safe canning can be purchased from Purdue University.  [https://mdc.itap.purdue.edu/item.asp?Item\_Number=AIG-539](https://mdc.itap.purdue.edu/item.asp?Item_Number=AIG-539)

I get a sense of power and control with each new skill I learn, each new can of beans I buy, each dollar I put in my emergency cash box. 

Some things I'm doing:

* Researching and reading about food preservation.
* Stockpiling canned vegetables, fruits, rice, powdered milk, beans, canned meat, oats, first aid supplies and whatever else I can squeeze out of my grocery budget.
* Canning and dehydrating (search for no specially equipment needed if your budget is tight)
* Detouring through the camping section of local stores looking for emergency items (cooking off-grid, emergency shelter items, etc.)
* Buying ammo.  I already have multiple firearms.
* Joining prepping subreddits.

I'll never forget the looks of confusion and the fear in the eyes of 20 and 30-somethings during the COVID food shortages.  My kids were as guilty as anyone in that they rarely had food in their fridges and pantries because they ate out so much.  They had never experienced an empty meat case or bare shelving.  

They won't be caught unprepared again. 

Please make food storage a priority so that a man doesn't come ""to save you"" and make demands in return.

It would be prudent maybe for Biden to do what he can to get ERA fully ratified before he leaves office. I don't think he'll get it done, but we only need one more state to declare a constitutional convention. It would be great to slap at least one weapon out of the Republican Party's hands.

Women who try to hide are at risk of being dragged out and beaten.","# Men beat women - old custom triggers wave of outrage

  
On the eve of St. Nicholas Day, a group of masked men chase women through the streets of Borkum and beat them with cow horns. The ""Klaasohm tradition"" remained hidden from the public for a long time.  


# No time? blue News summarizes for you​

* At the Klaasohm festival on the German island of Borkum, masked men chase women and beat them with a cow horn - a practice known as a ""tradition"".
* For a long time, the custom was kept secret from outsiders, but an [ARD report](https://www.ardmediathek.de/video/panorama-die-reporter/das-schweigen-der-insel-wenn-borkum-klaasohm-feiert/ndr/Y3JpZDovL25kci5kZS8xMzExXzIwMjQtMTEtMjYtMjEtMTU) shows the aggressive side of this ""tradition"".
* After fierce criticism and intervention from politicians and the public, the organizing association has announced that it will abolish cow horn beating.
* The custom allegedly goes back to the time of the whalers, who wanted to show their dominance over the women again after months of absence.

On the North Sea island of Borkum, a festival is celebrated every year on December 5 that is not all cheerful tones: Klaasohm. In this custom, masked men chase women and beat them with a cow horn.  
The ritual, which was kept secret from outsiders, has now caused widespread horror. The [ARD magazine Panorama](https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/borkum-am-vorabend-zum-nikolaustag-frauen-schlagen-a-4d1ea282-22f5-4f05-8ce6-6f9382152520) recently published a report showing the scenes of this bizarre ""Santa Claus custom"". In the report, women report anonymously on aggressive assaults to which they felt at the mercy of. Some were in pain for days after the beatings.  
  
The problematic nature of the festival is rarely discussed openly on the island, which has a population of around 5,000. According to research by [NDR](https://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/panorama/aktuell/Borkum-Frauen-Schlagen-bei-Klaasohm-soll-abgeschafft-werden,klaasohm106.html), the organizer - the Borkumer Jungens von 1830 association - expressly calls on its members to maintain secrecy.  


# Nobody should stay at home out of fear​

Unsurprisingly, neither the association nor the mayor of Borkum wanted to comment publicly at first. However, this was followed by a wave of outrage in Germany, which triggered a rethink among those responsible.  
  
Christine Arbogast, Lower Saxony's State Secretary in the Ministry of Social Affairs, made it clear: ""Customs and traditions are always very important. But it is clear that everything comes to an end where women feel unsafe and are afraid of corporal punishment.""  
  
She emphasized that no one has to stay at home out of fear: ""Anyone who wants to be spanked with a horn is allowed to do so. But anyone who doesn't want to must also be respected.""  


# Association understands the criticism​

The Borkum Boys' Association is now trying to calm the criticism. In a statement, they admitted that beating with cow horns used to be part of the tradition ""and in individual cases in recent years"".  
At the same time, the association ""expressly distanced itself from any form of violence against women"" and apologized for the ""historically grown actions of past years"".  
  
In future, they want to completely abolish the beating and make the festival more transparent in order to clear up misunderstandings.  
  
""We understand the criticism of the scenes shown in the report and feel obliged to bring about further changes,"" the statement reads.  


# Mayor finds ARD report ""dubious""​

The mayor of Borkum, Jürgen Akkermann, also commented on the accusations, but was less insightful. He criticized the Panorama magazine report as ""tendentious and dubious"". According to Akkermann, this opinion is also shared by many residents of the island.  
  
He emphasized that the festival on Borkum is celebrated by women, men and children together, both in the streets and in the pubs. ""Unfortunately, the positive voices don't get a say in the report,"" the mayor lamented.  
  
Jürgen Akkermann (non-party), mayor of the town of Borkum in the German state of Lower Saxony, finds the criticism of the Klaasohm custom exaggerated. (archive picture)  
Sina Schuldt/Keystone  
  
The Leer/Emden police station, which is responsible for security on Borkum, has also spoken out. In a message on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/PolizeiLeerEmden/posts/pfbid0UeZg4RuzMheDUDp89WS4Djavtawi2jcMR1G67f55momNuxBbaarX7oEZxtFJL3Atl?locale=de_DE), it states that no form of violence will be tolerated.  
  
If the police become aware of any assaults, they will be consistently prosecuted. In addition, the current media coverage will be included in the ""police assessment of the situation"". The police will accompany this year's ""Klaasohm"" with numerous officers.  
  
""We are taking a zero-tolerance approach,"" emphasized a spokesperson. A concept is currently being developed to prevent any form of violence at the event on the night of December 6.  


# Custom marks male dominance​

On Borkum itself, it is said that the Klaasohm custom goes back to the time of the whalers. After months of absence, the men returned at the end of the year and used this ritual to mark their return and male dominance. In doing so, they made it clear that they - and not the women - were back in charge on the island.  
  
Now that public pressure is growing, those responsible are promising changes - at the very least, the beating with cow horns will be abolished. It remains to be seen whether the announced transparency will actually find its way into the long-established festival.

While trying to stay open-minded and prioritising the main goal, still I'm worried that he's going to push me into volunteering with/for, playing or working out around men, which I'm no longer comfortable doing and feel somewhat against--don't we have to give enough of our free time, labour and space away? Not to mention I already have elder care responsibilities at home, work my rich uncles should be doing themselves or paying workers to.

Am unfit and no good at sport, but perhaps a woso football team could be a good start? Just to put out cones or help with coaching? My sister used to play, and from what I can tell those spaces seem wholly centred on girls & women, except for the occasional male coach.

Is there any real evidence that males in general innately lack emotional intelligence when compared to females, or is it all down to patriarchy? It could be down to patriarchy, as some girls and women are also susceptible to patriarchal programming through pick-me behaviours. Maybe my experience isn't the common one, but there seem to be more abusive males than pick-me women. I wonder if there are any reliable stats on this; I haven't been able to find anything.

  
People often claim that there aren't as many mental health resources out there for men, but most psychologists / psychiatrists are willing to work with men as much as women, right?

The internalized misogyny is showing and I can't tell him to stop that behavior because I feel like I'm forcing him and he doesn't put up too much interest on it either, he seems like he wants me to make his investigation and then read it out loud for him, and because of that I stopped talking with him about political or just social stuff.

Lately everyone around me has become so bigotred that I can't with the frustration, and I cant vent it with him either because he's part of the problem. I feel like it's shattering my relationship with him, and I need to tell him he's doing things wrong and needs to stop before this gets worse, but he is a very sensitive and emotional guy and has problems letting go of culpability. I don't want to hurt him too much but I'm bad at talking and I'm afraid I might end up making things worse.

For reference, I live in a red town, a conservative community, and I have family friends (that iv been cutting ties with for a while now) that are loudly conservative. — With the weeks following the election I notice that everyone I know irl that’s a conservative is super agitated and seems full of despair. Don’t get me wrong, im noticing men are being aggressive in person BUT they’re specifically acting how I would expect if they would if Trump had lost. 

On one hand it seems like this could be possibly due to how left voters and feminists are responding and it’s triggering them (for example 4B took off in the US the minute Trump was announced to be president)

Angela Davis
Mariame Kaba
Hannie Shaft
Truus and Freddie Oversteegen
Lyudmila Pavlichenko 
Virginia Hall
Sophie Scholl
Ahed Tamimi
Greta Thunberg 
Ursula K Le Guin 
Margaret Atwood
Jane Goodall
Bisan Owda 
Marie Skłodowska-Curie

Many of these women dedicated or are dedicating their lives to truth, justice, the natural world, human rights, spoke out against capitalism, or they literally killed Nazis like badasses. 

For fictional ladies, that's a bit harder. My favorite right now is Gertrude Robinson from The Magnus Archives audio drama podcast. I think I'm also quite drawn to women in the Crone archetype, as a way to embrace being powerful in old age and not desperately clinging to being attractive and fertile for men. 

Honestly, also: any woman older than me in public that calls me any variation of baby, sweetie, honey, mija, etc?? And how it just makes me feel instantly embraced and protected and like I would fight a pack of wolves for them??? Amazing. 10/10 random motherly community vibes, please adopt me. 

I find in women a wealth of knowledge, wisdom, compassion, integrity, and so much bravery. So much ingenuity. So much intelligence. I find them strong, resourceful, enduringly kind. They grow hope like Persephone in the garden, they hold so much of this world together. I read so many books by female activists and look to them time and again for wisdom. I want to be better, I want to do good, and I think there are so many examples of women doing the impossible in every movement. So much of women's work holds up the civil rights movements of the world, and always has. Lesbians stood by gay men in their community when no one else would in the AIDS crisis. Women did a lot of the work in leftist groups, in the black panthers, etc etc. When I want to believe changing the world is possible, I look to women doing the work.

I could go on for hours about the kind of crap he gets away with doing and saying . He gets enabled by both of my  parents and praised for the bare minimum and also has no respect for women due to his social media usage . I love him because he is my brother but I can’t help but hold resentment towards him and my parents . I don’t know what to do. Not to mention my family constantly stereotyping me as an mean and angry girl in my heart I know I’m not like that but it has affected my confidence and my social skills really negatively I can never make new friends . ,1733285956.0,,12,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1h67jv8/advice_please/,False

How many men did I ignore? 
How many men did I NOT move out of the way for? 
How many men did I not return smiles to?
How many men did I not answer questions for that they can Google themselves, hold the door for, etc.?
How many men did I make do more work? (I always pick the male cashier and let the ladies have an easier day)

FreeSpiritTreeSpirit,t2_1d1ro1n86g,t3_1h69nos,,New Year’s Resolution - A Year of Centering Women,"I’ve decided to set a New Year’s resolution for 2025 to do at least one thing every day to center women. My hope is that although I may need to be intentional and deliberate about it at first, eventually it will become second nature and I will automatically do it without thinking.

I’m planning on keeping a journal or notebook where I will make an entry every day and ask myself, “What did I do to center women today?”

I’m putting together a list of things I can do and would love to get more ideas.

Here’s what I have so far:

Follow, like, or share a video from a woman content creator

Give a woman a compliment

Help a woman (could be a friend, neighbor, or random community member)

Listen to music by women artists (I’m going to create a specific playlist for this so it’s easy to do)

Make a purchase from a woman-owned business or buy an item handcrafted by a woman

Read an article about an inspirational woman, 
past or present

Hang out with a woman/women

Call, email, or text a friend

Read a book written by a woman

Watch a movie or documentary about a woman or that centers women


I am also going to count things I do to center myself, such as:

Take a mental health day when I need it

Say no to doing too much

Set a boundary I would have normally let slide


I want to be clear that my use of the word “women” here also includes trans women.

Some of these things are things I would naturally do anyway, but other days I might need to make a conscious effort to do something. 

I would love suggestions for more ideas!",1733293347.0,,34,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1h69nos/new_years_resolution_a_year_of_centering_women/,False
saembrosaem,t2_12df9h7qqp,t3_1h69wmv,,I don’t believe men have the ability to love. At all. ,"I think what they experience in relationships is something completely different than what we experience and it’s something we don’t think about or realize because humans have a natural tendency to assume others think and perceive the world the way we do. It’s why women often times assume the best of men, when it isn’t deserved, until they get burned and learn the hard way about true male nature. And men likewise assume the worst of women, treat them accordingly and then women leave and they regret it, realizing she was the best thing that ever happened to him. It’s all projection of ourselves. We project our loving nature onto them and they project their exploitive nature onto us. That’s why many of them think we’re untrustworthy snakes and they despise us for it.

They may desire things like one would desire food but they don’t have empathy the same way women do and they cannot love. They say that oxytocin is the love hormone that makes people bond through feelings of safety, warmth and care and it’s been proven that women experience this at far higher levels than men. Oxytocin tends to be very low in men, if existent at all. It explains why women love things that induce those feelings more like pets such as dogs and cats and men tend to hate them. If you think about it it makes everything that men do and how they behave in relationships make total sense. They do not feel love the way we feel love. For them sex and bonding is not the same thing that it is for women. When I had this realization, that pretty much all my connections with men in the past were one sided, I was experiencing something completely different in those relationships than what they were experiencing, it was a really unsettling feeling. 

I think that men only feel FOMO out of some primal sense of competition. You only ever hear a man hopelessly in love when he can’t have something or after fucking up a good thing and losing it. But they never love what they have available right in front of them. Most if not all of them treat women life garbage who are committed and caring towards them. Many men admit this themselves. 

Anyway, in a weird way it’s kind of a liberating realization to let go of all those expectations of men. I look at them like I would look at an animal in the wild that could potentially be dangerous. Never open up to them, never be vulnerable or let them truly see you on a deep level. But also don’t have any expectations. I just talk to them in a very superficial and detached manner, if it’s absolutely necessary to do so. Always keeping a good distance. I am from now on only nurturing and investing in all my female relationships. I think women have the potential to be far happier and experience deeper love growing old with a good group of best friends vs a man.

2. I crave male attention whenever I feel lonely, and I seek praise from others when I dress up or wear makeup.

The only protection we have is our family, even if we hate them and vice versa, strangers do not gaf about us, and   we risk being raped assaulted and prostitued the second we are vulnerable. I know that a lot of rapes happen inside the home, but not having a home is still so much worse. Like I said strangers dont care, men are not our friends, they are predators that will take advantage of you or expect you to prostitute yourself to them as an exchange for any help.
Ending up homeless is basically a rape guaranteed as a woman ... No way to avoid it, but most autistic people can't hold a normal job.
Seriously this world does not give a single fuck about protecting women. I have such a crippling fear of rape it haunts me everyday, I'm scared of my future. I have almost no one, I don't wanna go out in this world because I know the consequences, I don't wanna be around any man, cause I know the consequences... It's truly terrifying.
Highly sensitive autistic women have it worse than HSP men. I made a post stating that once and a man replied that he was rape by a woman and then a woman also replied that men abused her but she still doesn't hate them and men are wonderful blah blah
Mind you autistic women ATTEMPT two times more than autistic men and more than neurotypical men, 1 in 13 autistic women ATTEMPTS.

I let my friend know on my way home in the morning that I had to go into work an hour early, so could not walk the dog. When I woke up for work this afternoon, I was grumpy and tired. But then as I'm leaving I see she had left donuts for me on the banister. She remembered my favorite type, too!

I was living alone before this, but the one time I let a man live with me, he did everything he could do absorb every last fucking dime, second, and kilojoule I had not expended toward working, to being an abusive hobo-sexual to me.  

I want to buy my own home someday, but if I cannot, I want to try to stay in this place and live with other Bs. 

I just want to put the message out there that women wanting to divest from men, but not their own pockets, may want to consider teaming up to enter their Golden Girls era earlier than was depicted on that show. My house is clean, quiet, calm and I feel cared for and attended to in a way I never felt with a man. There are a lot of ways to finance these purchases as a group, and I think women who are ready to stop pouring money into the patriarchal fantasy of the white picket fence, might find better returns living collectively. 

The dream for me in ten years is to have enough capital (either myself or more likely collectively with other women) and get our own multifamily property, or five or six neighboring single family homes and just vibe. That will be my home base, and a place to die, hopefully peacefully and surrounded by the community of women I have gathered around me and, as another friend of mine likes to say ""shown to the gates of bitchiness.""",1733568125.0,,372,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1h8px9v/a_queen_and_her_castle/,False

StardewMellie,t2_1cjtatz0ve,t3_1h8vuep,,A Case for Gray Rock (aka I Need a New Grocery Store),"I'm nice to everyone I feel familiar with, especially places I frequent regularly - small town charm and whatnot.  This grocery store is next to my home, so I'm in there almost daily, and have become friendly with most of the employees.  Extra-friendly with the women of course, but will talk with anyone.

Last night, I was on my way home and needed to pick something up for dinner.  One of the men who bags saw me on-line and came up to the other cashier and said he needed to talk to me.  As soon as I heard that, ""I need to talk to her,"" my heart fucking sank.  I knew what was coming...

The bagger bagged my food up, I paid and reached for the bag.  He said he'd help me out and, again, he needed to talk to me.  In my head I'm screaming.  We were heading to the door and I reached for my bag again and he pulled it away.  I got pissed and should've said something but my mind went blank and I just crossed my arms.

Outside, he asked if I was single, I said yes.  He asked if I dated, I said I have no interest in dating.  He said I seemed chill (I fucking hate that, it's code for ""I see you as a pushover""), I said it's because I don't date, so I don't have any stress.  He gets quiet, I say I'm right over there, and he finally gives me my bag.

Now, because this dude is huge and tall (and I'm 5 foot nothing), it's dark outside, and I assume every guy is a potential rapist/murderer, I tell him thank you and I'm flattered.  He doesn't say anything, just walks off - a rejected guy is so scary, so I unlock only my door, jump in and immediately lock the door.

So yep, need a new grocery store.  Remember:  just do yourself a favor and gray rock all dudes.  I thought I was safe since I've been a regular there for years, and that hasn't happened once.

s_s_akram,t2_ckbj3udz,t3_1h8wd8w,,Need advice. I'm not good at anything. ,"Hello sisters,

So I have been a part of this movement for many years now, and I am fully aware of how important it is to stay in school and have our own careers. And I have really tried my best to do so. I'm 21 and a final year university student now, and even though I have really tried and worked hard, I'll be graduating with a CGPA of just 2.8 in a bachelor of psychology.

I really sat down and reflected a while ago and noticed that even back in high school, my grades were quite low as well, even though I would study for so long and try out many types of studying techniques (eg: spaced repetition, Pomodoro). Nothing has worked for me.

One thing I have decided is that once I graduate and get my degree, I no longer want to go back to school.  I have tried my all,  stayed up countless nights, and spent hours covering the same topics over and over, but I just realistically want to give up on all this now. What's the point? I am just not good at school no matter what. I'm not even trying to be negative here, just realistic. Why waste more time and money? To be honest, I think I definitely have some type of learning disability, but I've never gone to get diagnosed.

So now I'm just stuck. What are my options? I wanted to go into the trades but I am so horrible with math (even the most basic of math, I failed Intro to Algebra twice in high school and was able to eventually pass with a C-) and my body just isn't fit for that kind of work sadly (I am 5'0 and naturally very weak even though I eat normally).

I want a stable job so badly, but literally, what are my options? I feel extremely disheartened and left behind when I see other sisters excelling in their careers and independence. I am a bit better at learning more hands-on rather than conceptual stuff, but even then it's just average at best. I don't even care about extremely high-paying jobs, to be honest. I'll never be getting married or having any kids/pets, so I know that type of cost won't ever exist in my life. I'm a relatively cheap person in all ways too, and honestly, I don't mind living with 1 roommate to help keep rent low. I don't have any big dreams or goals in life, I just want to live a minimal, simple, and quiet life.",1733589608.0,,41,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1h8wd8w/need_advice_im_not_good_at_anything/,False

FreeSpiritTreeSpirit,t2_1d1ro1n86g,t3_1h90o1c,,Building community & solidarity with women,"I posted a story as a comment in another thread and someone suggested I post it here in the main.

A few years ago, I was walking in the city and got lost, I ended up near a bridge and an industrial section where there wasn’t much else around. I noticed a man had been following me for a few blocks and I was scared.

I saw a group of young women a street or two over, so I quickly made my way over to them and started walking right behind them. I didn’t want to scare them and felt kinda creepy walking so close. They heard my footsteps and turned around to see if they should move off to the side so I could pass.

I said “Sorry I’m walking so close to you, not trying to be creepy, but there was a guy following me.” They looked over and saw him and were like, “Oh, it’s ok, sure, you can walk with us” and we all continued as a group. After that, he went a different way.

I’m sharing this as an example of the small things we can all do for each other to build community and stand in solidarity with other women.

Building community doesn’t have to mean getting out and making new friends (though that’s still a good idea), it can also mean just looking out for one another. Notice women when you’re out and about. Look at them, make eye contact, say hi, strike up a conversation. If something seems off, find a way to ask if they’re ok.

I’ve seen this kind of solidarity a lot in women’s bathrooms in bars. I once saw a woman crying and all the other women were checking in with her, asking if she was ok, if she needed anything, etc. Turns out her dress had ripped, but thankfully someone had a safety pin.

These are just small things we can do to help keep each other safe and well and build broader webs of community.",1733601199.0,,125,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1h90o1c/building_community_solidarity_with_women/,False

Vivian_Speaks,t2_dr7n04v8,t3_1h93251,,How we move forward on this subreddit,"Good afternoon everyone,

I've been apart of this subreddit for a couple of months now and I've noticed an alarming amount of in-fighting as of late. It disheartens me to see how derailed we've become over the last month. As we are all aware, division leads to the weakening of a group's ability to move forward in the right direction. It is important to recognize that we are NOT exempt from this phenomenon.

I don't think this post is aimed towards the moderators as per se but more so the members of this subreddit. Thankfully, the moderators have put in place a clear set of rules. Now we just have to discuss and learn how to navigate them as a community.

On this day, December 7th, 2024. I call for our collective energy to be restored and redirected to following the 4B movement. As I type, I am intentionally mindful of my words as to respect and abide by the currently listed 9 subreddit rules. I have also reviewed the community highlights to ensure that I am in the clear.

At first, there was a rising amount of posts asking if trans women were allowed to participate in the 4B movement. There was no malicious intent behind these posts. Although, I noticed that these posts derailed us for a bit since all women are allowed to participate in 4B movement. Thankfully, this has been resolved through the mods implementing subreddit rule #8, commenting underneath and locking such posts.

Now it appears a new type of posts have begun to rise. Posts that call into question allyship's eligibility, involvement and tolerance on this subreddit. Plus, the potential issue of women praising male partners or ""the good men"" in this space. Further sparking discussions on what limitations should be put in place without promoting censorship. I believe will be a difficult balance to attain and enforce. Nonetheless, it is important in order to avoid future looping and derailing.

I've quietly watched from afar and remained silent for awhile because I did not want to accidently contribute to the in-fighting, derail the conversation or spark controversy. However, I believe it's important for me to speak up now for the future of our community. I foresee this becoming a long-term issue if it remains unaddressed.

I call upon the subreddit to bring forth unity, strength and sisterhood during this challenging time. Please extend kindness, patience and understanding to one another as we navigate this together. Remember, ""United we stand, divided we fall"".

On a meta note, I believe we need a 10th 4B subreddit rule for clarity. We really need to know what the policy/limitations for allies are. Respectfully, we need a guideline to know what will be tolerated so we can develop a universal understanding of the rules on this subreddit. I believe doing so will finally put an end to the in-fighting. Additionally, clarity on the subreddit's current stance on ""male allies"" participating in this space would be helpful.

Once that's out of the way, we must focus on uniting. We must be patient with the women who are still in the process of waking up. We must stand together to make change while remaining anonymous. We do not seek validation, acceptance or reactions from others. We move in silence. We seek peace, safety and well-being. We follow 4B for ourselves and support one another on our journeys. That being said, I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts. Thank you!",1733607853.0,,77,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1h93251/how_we_move_forward_on_this_subreddit/,False

I think in today’s political climate especially, it’s important to think about where our money is going and who we are supporting.

I will be continuing on creating more lists and I would love to get feedback on what kind of lists of resources you would like to see. For example, I see the benefit of creating a list of handywomen in each state. Please share if you any ideas!

Dogtimeletsgooo,t2_12exgk07xm,t3_1h9bjpo,,Shifting priorities,"I haven't dated in a good while. I think I've been coming to 4B for a while, well before I really knew what it was. I was identifying as poly, and did not want to be anyone's primary or live in partner. Eventually I just kept moving further and further away from dating at all, just fwb. Then I didn't even feel like that was really worth the effort, and I've quit really going out. 

With men, anyway. I started questioning a while ago and have been dating women on and off a little over the past year, and it's already been way more rewarding. But still, I just got comfortable being single, and it's mainly worked out into friendships which is great. 

I'm going back to school for another degree in spring, and I've just been very much learning to love my solitude. I was always an introvert but now I'm thriving in it, really. I'll go on little self dates. I look forward to days home alone, I can take my dogs for walks in whatever park I want or bake at 2am or stay up all night reading without disturbing anyone. 

I really enjoy being single. Maybe I'll find a gf someday, but I think I'll always value having my own space. I do not expect to find what I need emotionally or practically from a partner in a man, and I'm at peace with that. I have really loved not having to divide up my Me Time to placate and nurture and teach a dude empathy only for them to sigh and roll their eyes at the first sign we need to have a serious conversation or the first time they hear No. 

I'm going to focus on school and my career the next couple of years. I'm getting involved in my community with volunteer work. I have creative hobbies I'm getting back into. I have so many things I want to do, and I've got so much more time and emotional capacity when I'm not trying to navigate an emotionally stunted person who barely sees me as an equal. 

Invest your time and energy in yourself. Give yourself the support and encouragement you need. Give yourself the enrichment and quality time. It'll never be wasted that way. ",1733634633.0,,45,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1h9bjpo/shifting_priorities/,False

Sweaty-Ad-3526,t2_72kzqktu,t3_1h9eu1l,,I not only decenter men but I also decenter beauty. ,"I used to be so hurt and terrified by the fact I didnt meet beauty standards. I would go hours looking at makeup tutorials, hair tutorials etc trying to make my face pleasing to the male gaze. I felt Like I didn’t deserve happiness unless I could be pretty. That I wasn’t allowed to be happy. 

I one day successfully managed to do that and it opened my eyes to how meaningless male validation really is. All the “good treatment” I couldn’t dream of started coming to me easily and so suddenly. The same people who couldn’t care less about me suddenly are putting so much effort to include me in things. Suddenly so welcoming. The voice I’ve always had suddenly can be heard. But I was never seen, not for who I was anyway. 

I was thinking “these people wouldn’t give a damn about me if I didn’t put all this ridiculous effort. Is it really worth it? I did all this work for this?” I was trying to seek love, but what “love” exactly? A love that can only be given if I look a certain way? A love that takes my traits I have always had and is only able to be put value on them depending on the placement and size of my features? 

I stopped trying so hard to look attractive after realizing how pointless it was. I started focusing on my comfort over beauty. My freedom over the male gaze. I don’t see the point in caring about the approval and validation of people who are so disingenuous, and so fickle.

 I wasn’t put on this earth to fit the male gaze. I wasn’t put on this earth to be seen as “pretty” I was put on this earth to live. Live the way I want. And that goes for you too ladies! Males and their desires and preferences are not and were never a requirement for emotional fulfillment.

4BIsTheWay,t2_1cugg8pslb,t3_1h9ly8a,,Women who already have children and 4B,"Wikipedia describes 4B as ""Its proponents do not date men, get married to men, have sex with men, or have children with men."" Now I really don't know where the ""official"" tenets are posted or if there are rules about this, but many women have come to 4B after having already had children. They are no longer with the fathers (if they ever were to begin with) or are in process of leaving/having filed divorce etc. They do not intend on having any more children with men/sex w men/dating/marriage.

Because no one can go back in time and erase their kids or former marriage or dating/sexual activities, and they can only go forward, wouldn't it be correct to say that women with kids can still do 4B?

If you've had sex with men before you can do 4B if you will not have sex with men anymore.

If you've dated men, you can do 4B if you will no longer date men.

If you have been married but you're divorced or in process of divorce, you can do 4B if you will not get married again.

What do you do if you already have a child? (Also, does it make a difference if your child is female or male? I do see women extolling the virtues of their sons which is not ""decentering"" males... what if you're the mother of a girl, and what if you're teaching your daughter to 4B as well?) 

Is 4B explicitly about not having children at all, ever, or is it about not having children \***with males**\*? Can a woman have a kid going forward with say, a sperm bank and no male involvement at all? Can women who already have kids go forward with 4B only if they resolve to not have any more kids at all, or just none with males (which would happen anyway if they're not having sex with males)? 

Or do all 4B women have to **have never been pregnant** to begin with? 

What about women who have children through pregnancies where they were r\*aped or could not make another choice in the matter?

It seems the rules don't get deeply into these nuances and recent discussion made me think about it more.

For the identification brings in our ego, which can limit our ability to live out our true nature. 

In order to separate the ego from our true nature it is best to imagine who you are after death has stripped all your roles and identities (ie. Not a woman, sister, daughter, job title, etc). After death you are the Being which just had a human experience. 

You are probably also the being that likes challenges because why else would one choose the obstacles which come with being the female form when you could have chosen the easier path of taken on the male form instead? Perhaps the goal of this life for you was to gain strength, tolerance, and stamina by putting yourself in a world clearly not made for you 😂.

So try to remember you are not your pain, you are the being which chose the Hardest Possible Life and will accept and embrace these obstacles which will inevitably make you stronger.

Patriarchal society doesn’t provide women with a vision of life without men, and even I at times have difficulty solidly envisioning the same type of golden ideals sans male toxicity. The idea of marriage and being swept off our feet is fed to girls from a young age as something to aspire to. I never dreamed of that personally but I also never had a clear vision of what life would be like without it. 

We need to change that — not only from protesting it, but from offering an equally strong dream of an alternative. 

The anger here is very healthy and important to work through. But let’s also create a solid, tangible vision of a fulfilling, independent life, not just for ourselves, but for those who come after us. We need to cultivate a variety of dreams to feed our souls and future generations.

AlysonBurgers,t2_d3e7r7q,t3_1hbc1rg,,It wasn't always this way,"I just wanted to share a book I've started reading that has given me hope for our world. It's by Marija Gimbutas,  an archaeologist and anthropologist who taught at UCLA. To quote from her brilliant work:

""Archaeologists and historians have assumed that civilization implies a hierarchical political and religious organization, warfare, a class stratification, and a complex division of labor. This pattern is indeed typical of androcratic (male-dominated) societies such as Indo-European but does not apply to the gynocentric (woman/mother-centered) cultures described in this book. The civilization that flourished in Old Europe between 6500 and 3500 BC and in Crete until 1450 BC enjoyed a long period of uninterrupted peaceful living which produced artistic expressions of graceful beauty and refinement, demonstrating a higher quality of life than many androcratic, classed societies. 

I reject the assumption that civilization refers only to andocratic warrior societies. The generative basis of any civilization lies in its degree of artistic creation, aesthetic achievements, non-material values, and freedom which make life meaningful and enjoyable for all its citizens as well as a balance of powers between the sexes. [ . . . ] Old Europeans had towns with a considerable concentration of population, temples several stories high, a sacred script, spacious houses of four or five rooms, professional ceramices, weavers, copper and gold metallurgists, and other artisans producing a range of sophisticated goods. 

[ . . . ]

It is a gross misunderstanding to imagine warfare as endemic to the human condition. Widespread fighting and fortification building have indeed been the way of life for most of our direct ancestors from the Bronze Age up until now. However, this was not the case in the Paleolithic and Neolithic. There are no depictions of arms (weapons used against other humans) in Paleolithic cave paintings, nor are there remains of weapons used by man against man during the Neolithic of old Europe. From some 150 paintings that survived at Catal Huyuk, there is not one depicting a scene of conflict or fighting, or of war or torture. 

[ . . . ] The religion of the Goddess reflected a matristic, matrilineal, and endogamic social order for most of early human history. This was not necessarily ""matriarchy,"" which wrongly implies ""rule"" by women as a mirror image of androcracy. A matrifocal tradition continued throughout the early agricultural societies of Europe, Anatolia, and the near East, as well as Minoan Crete. The emphasis in these cultures was on technologies that nourished people's lives, in contrast to the andocratic focus on domination.""

I think it is important to discuss misogyny, so it doesn't help to just never talk about men and ignore the problem. As a society, we don't talk about misogyny enough, actually. But I understand women want a place where they can be 4B that doesn't even mention men. So here it is!

We're bombarded by media with examples of how we should act, think, and most of all, look. I played that game until my late 30s, then I closed off for good.

I wanted to get back to the real me, the me I was as a girl before everything was stolen from me, my sense of worth, my voice, my true self. I've come a long way to getting that back, and certainly engaging in this amazing community has helped so much, so I want to share this idea of reaching way down into who we were originally before it all went sideways. The most healing thing I've done is visualize conversations with my child self and my older self, all three of us sharing together. It may sound strange, but it got me back to who I actually am. 

What are some of the things you've done to get back your authentic self, or has this even been your experience? Were you strong enough to not be affected at all? I'm really looking forward to seeing any responses to this. Thanks for being my sisters.

“Paxton is asking a Collin County court to block Carpenter from violating Texas law, and order her to pay $100,000 for every violation of the state’s near-total abortion ban. Violating Texas’ near-total abortion ban comes with up to life in prison, fines of at least $100,000 and the loss of a provider’s Texas medical license.

Affectionate_While3,t2_1c18hml4jl,t3_1hdva1q,,This is your daily reminder that romantic love as sold by patriarchy is a social construct,"Girls are raised from birth on media promising them a “Prince Charming” who acts nothing like any man on Earth has ever acted, and a perpetually blissful relationship that doesn’t resemble any romantic relationship anyone has ever had. But this portrayal of marriage to a man being light years beyond any other kind of relationship, almost akin to reaching nirvana, is beaten into our heads young, and gives us the interminable sense that if we don’t pursue it, we’ll never experience emotional fulfillment. So women spend their entire lives subjecting themselves to male abuse over and over again under the premise that they just haven’t found the right one, or even that it’s their own fault for “choosing wrong.”

But in reality, this vision of romantic love is merely a social construct of the West that exists for no purpose other than to keep women brainwashed into giving more of their emotional and sexual labor to men. It seems to have been an invention of Medieval French art, most likely. Even as recently as the classical Greeks, they had no word for romantic love despite having an entire dictionary of words for love. They had “eros,” which is the word for sexual attraction, and they had “philia,” for affectionate love between equals. But nothing for romantic love.

Historically, love between adult same-sex friends has been the most consistently respectful and passionate, especially between women. Even up to the dawn of the 20th century, most Westerners would sooner write a love poem about their best friend than about their spouse, who as often as not was merely a fixture of convenience. Friends even used to take [intimate photographs](https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/victorian-men-intimate-embracing/) while sitting on each other’s laps, or otherwise being physically close (fewer examples of women exist from this era because they were being locked in their houses by this point). Some spilled into erotic friendships due to the strength of their regard for each other, even for some women who weren’t typically same-sex attracted otherwise.

In other cultures, love ceremonies for [adult female friends](https://academic.oup.com/book/36058/chapter-abstract/313133932?redirectedFrom=fulltext) continue to this day (although threatened by pan-Westernism), and are often considered much more emotionally meaningful than marriage to a man. While there surely are couples who love each other, it appears that most societies just see it as lust coupled with affinity — not its own brand of nirvana-inducing experience. And consequently, they recognize that it’s entirely possible for people to experience love that is just as strong, or stronger, in non-romantic relationships.

On some level, I wonder if one of the reasons why feminism was more superficially successful in the West than elsewhere, is because men knew they already had their hooks in girls’ minds that they would never find anything as meaningful as a man, which keeps the majority of women sacrificing their female relationships in favor of serving men despite having the right to choose otherwise. Nowhere else on Earth has pushed the “nirvana-inducing man” narrative as successfully as the West. And after all, the strongest prison is the mind. Why bother with physical cells when they already had us trapped in mental ones?

In reality, women are pursuing a fiction that offers them nothing. Women married to men are sadder, sicker, lonelier, and ultimately die younger compared to single women. Even as badly diminished as the institution of female camaraderie is, women who stick to it are better off in every way compared t women who abandon it in favor of chasing a fantasy with men.

And I say all of this to set the stage for this essential point: if you are considering 4B, but are afraid of what you might be giving up, what I am saying is that you literally aren’t giving up anything.

The fantasy of romantic love you are hoping to find doesn’t exist. There’s nothing inherently natural about humans pairing up and isolating themselves in a house until they die, which is why literally no one ever did that until patriarchy took over (and less patriarchal cultures still don’t). I’ve known those “happy couples” where the women will gush about how great their husband is 30 years on. Behind the scenes, that’s not the reality. I don’t know if it’s an issue of standards of what, but I certainly wouldn’t want to be in their position.

This vision of romantic love serves no one except men. Men benefit from your isolation. Men benefit from your escapism into a vision of them that doesn’t exist. Men benefit from women believing that a life centered around other women is an emotionally empty one, despite the towering mountain of evidence to the contrary.

Romantic love is just a tool of patriarchy. In a state of nature, humans like happy fun time, and sometimes stay together for a while, but the meat and potatoes of their social well-being is their larger tribe and other women — certainly emotionally, and sometimes even sexually.

You literally aren’t giving up anything by going 4B. The only thing you’re losing is the weight of the delusions you’ve been fed by Disney since you were in pull-ups, and that is a loss that does nothing but make you healthier.

A woman-centered life gives you an opportunity to experience real love in a way a man-centered one can never provide.",1734151593.0,,918,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1hdva1q/this_is_your_daily_reminder_that_romantic_love_as/,False

There are a lot of fields in which women are the majority of the experts. Sometimes these fields are diminished socially, precisely because the majority of the experts are women. Don't fall for the hype! Learning any of these skills takes a huge amount of intellectual effort, and can sustain your creativity and interest for a lifetime.

**Dance classes!** Most dance teachers are women, and so are most dance students. Dance forms like ballet, jazz, tap, contemporary dance, and the infinite forms of street dance are so rich and complex, and not only take physical effort to learn, but will hone your ability to memorize, to understand spatial relationships, and to learn concrete anatomy. Studying dance is one of the most intellectually rigorous things I have ever done in my life.

**Textile arts!** Throughout history and worldwide, most experts in textile arts have been women. Textile arts have been tragically undervalued, possibly because not only are they produced by women, but also because not only are they beautiful, they're useful as well. Studying knitting, crochet, spinning, dying, sewing, and the infinite variety of textile arts with brilliant women teachers can fill your life with creativity forever, and you may even be able to become less dependent on textile products that are made unethically.

**Cooking!** Sure, lots of the celebrity chefs are men, but most great chefs and cooks are women. Once again, a lifetime of things to learn! Being able to nourish yourself with delicious things increases your independence, your self-efficacy, and if you have the right teachers, you can link yourself to a historical chain of talented, highly-skilled women.

There are so many more fields out there in which there are amazing, underappreciated women experts. Study with them! They can change your life!",1734200045.0,,98,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1he8rs6/study_with_women_teachers/,False

djsus-susdj,t2_vh2fryrh,t3_1hepsv9,,What does the role of conventional attractiveness play in your life?,"As a 4B woman who has always been considered “conventionally attractive”, I feel that it is most definitely a curse most of the time. It’s a huge reason why I joined the 4B movement. I live in constant fear of being raped. I’m at an age where most of my friends have gotten married, had babies, and moved on with their lives. I guess I feel a bit isolated, lost in life, unsure of how to plan my next steps. 

I’ve always struggled to maintain friendships at any capacity. I don’t think I’ve ever had a genuine platonic male friendship, including with gay men. It seems I’m just a caricature to them. Women who are male-centered tend to instantaneously disapprove of me. I live in an area that is “proudly” patriarchal (lots of maga losers). So it gets super lonely at times. I’m preparing to move to a big city in Spain soon. I’m basically starting my life over from scratch, hoping to build a community of likeminded women.

I just don’t know how to do that lol. I don’t know how to present my physical appearance in a way that demonstrates my alliance to feminist causes, but still feels authentically true to myself. Idk if anyone ever read the book “invisible monsters” by Chuck Palaniuk. It’s about a model who shoots half of her own face off. Because she’s tired of being objectified for her looks. Men only want her for her body, women hate her out of envy due to the attention she gets from men. So she’s ostracized and alone all the time. No one knows her or cares to know her beyond her appearance. I’ve resonated with this narrative my entire life, unfortunately.

Other times I’m addicted to the “power” I guess that I can wield knowing that I’m “above average” in looks. A reckless part of me (which I chose not to indulge due to my commitment to 4B) feels like I could “stick it to the patriarchy” by marrying the richest guy I could find. And taking him for everything he’s worth. I intuitively know that’s not the way to achieve a peaceful life. But I lack guidance, I’ve never had a positive female role model in my life. My mom is a major POS, my dad is the “stable” parent and even he has major POS tendencies. The rest of my family is the saddest bunch of abusive men and pick me enabler women you’ve ever seen.

I’m curious to know how many 4B / 4B adjacent women would approximately identify themselves as “above average” in looks? As opposed to “average” or “below average”? How have these arbitrary labels impacted your life and your decision to join this movement? How does it impact your ability to form female friendships and maintain a likeminded community? 

Again, I’d like to reiterate that I use these labels loosely, only as a way to illustrate how societal’s standards for women have impacted you, personally, in your life and decision to join 4B. I’m still new to the movement, I’m open to any and all suggestions. If you’re still reading, thank you!

Edited to add: I’m touched by all the responses and will be replying to many of them individually! Thank you to everyone who participated.

I've learned a topic through chatgpt that i think, it could be interesting to share

The *cultural gaslighting* to women when it comes in reaching for their emocional needs in relationships.

Due to have always been perceived women as excessively emotional for bieng women, they tend to relay less or doubt their needs from this ""cultural gaslighting"" that is instilled on us since we are little, that benefits men

Because of that, when women express needs in their relationships, the environment and society makes women belive and doubt their selves and needs, and tend to end up in bad relationships because they are overreacting or being sensitive

But just because my man loves me and I might overreact, I might just ignore my needs

Like, it might seem so obvious, but I never really thought of it so consciously

Dogtimeletsgooo,t2_12exgk07xm,t3_1hfhnmx,,"Women's ""work"" never stops in marriage","My grandfather was always an incredibly abusive, hateful man who terrorized his wife and kids. He was a miserable person to be around. We tried to convince my grandma to leave for ages, but that trauma bond is strong. He robbed her of any joy in life, made her miserable, and made her life so small. 

Now, he's at the end of his life and my family is doing full time caregiver things around the clock for him. That's just part of having loved ones- they get sick or elderly, you care for them. 

That's fine... but he never once really helped out when my grandma was going through cancer treatment. So now that he's going through shit, she's about the same age but having to change HIS diapers and take care of him around the clock. She feels like she can never leave his side to do anything, but he left all the time to go drink himself absolutely blind stinking drunk while she was in treatment. 

This has caused me to reflect a lot on Marriage, and the choice to avoid it. 

At the end of their lives and ours, we are still expected to work for them while they do not seem to feel compelled to provide the same care and effort. 

My grandma should be spending her last years visiting relatives, seeing grandchildren and great grandchildren grow up, and resting. But she's not even able to have the peace of his absence for a few hours now. He was hateful every minute of every day, and now she's got to change his diapers until he croaks. 

Men see us as part of their retirement plan. 

Of course they see us as child bearers and a source of domestic labor, but the woman's work never stops. Men could retire, but domestic labor never stops- and then you're expected to become his caregiver at the end of your life, when YOU honestly need one yourself. 

If he'd been less toxic and abusive, I could see this just being a labor of deep love and familiarity. He wasn't, though. Even if he was a chill guy, though, it's very upsetting that people (including my grandma) think that she should just be stuck working like this until he croaks when there are OTHER OPTIONS. She's got grown children who are doing well for themselves mostly, and he's a veteran. They could afford to get him full time care, or put him up somewhere. But all of her children are men, of course, and they naturally just assume she should be doing the work of several trained professionals around the clock by herself, with no training. 

Only one of her children really stepped up fully to help with that, and it was one of the most abused kids. It's truly baffling to me that the two people he abused the most are the ones babysitting him on his death bed now. He doesn't deserve them. And I'm quite angry with my uncles for all just looking away while my grandmother shoulders such a heavy burden when she should not have to, just because they think it's a woman's job to look after the men in the family. 

This will never be me. I refuse. I'm never going to tolerate a man making my life miserable for decades, just to get to the end of my life and have to wait on him hand and foot still.

I've also noticed the outfits that several of the women wear on the videos. Many of them are dressed in a very revealing manner (sometimes to the point of near nudity) just to boost their chances of getting a date with these men, who will most likely only use them for a hookup.

Another disturbing feature of ""20 v 1"" and ""Pop The Balloon"" is that most of the female participants are Black. Black women already deal with being hypersexualized and disrespected by society at large, so why would any of us willingly go on videos like this, just to be degraded even further?

ChikiChikiBangBang,t2_pe8153ft,t3_1hfvur3,,Love is is scam to keep domestic labour unregulated and cheap for the husband,"Point blank. We live in an age where everything is regulated in terms of legality. And yet the only job in the world that still has no tangible regulations on work compensation and payment is being someone’s wife. Why? Because you signed up for it because you love that person. Society conditions you that love is all that matters and who could put a price on love? 

A billionaire can give his wife an egg apron for her birthday without any legal repercussions for under-paying/compensating his wife’s work. And these men aren’t oblivious to this either. They happily exploit this under the guise of wholesome homesteading. 

If this happens in any other, it would be considered slavery. But nooo, it’s love, don’t think too deep into it, trust and depend your autonomy and right to income on your partner (a stranger you only met after 20+ years of your life). If you think too deep and demand fair compensation, people associate you with gold digging instead. Smh. And a lot of countries have no laws to protect women when their spouses forces them to quit their jobs. 

I’m not saying being a SAHM is bad. I just think it’s about time there’s a fixed criteria on benefits and fair pay when it comes to domestic labour done by stay at home parents.

Can you imagine the utter relief of an offer like that- all that work taken off your shoulders? Seriously. We will never know or have that EVER from men. They've been running this game too long and now they want all that AND to no longer have to protect us or pay for us. At least in the 40s and 50s some women got that. There is no longer a contractual exchange ... they're just getting it all for free now- most just lying about love to get the freebies. I have seen whole forums where they teach each other how to lie and manipulate effectively so women will believe them and give them sex and attention.

The fact that we can't imagine marriage benefitting us as it does them should illuminate the disparity and plight of women in all but a few ancient societies. Can you foresee the hate and anger if we expected even a fraction of the same of them, all for the cost of a ring? The whole racket is nothing but smoke and mirrors. Let's see how they do on their own for a generation.

The reason why I prefer fictional men it's because whoever is in charge of writing these characters, it's up to YOU as a writer however you want to write these characters of yours.

With fictional men, you can write them to be whatever you want them to be in your stories. They can be compassionate, empathetic, and NOT write them committing serious, horrific criminal acts to women the same way real-life men always do everyday and every year and are always the one ends up on the news more after their crimes was exposed.

playgirlkitty,t2_lenasnnu,t3_1hgyzq1,,men lack humanity,"P.S.→ please read with nuance! this is just my experience 

sometimes i feel bad for men. well not really, but i’m thankful i’m not one if that makes sense. they don’t realise that the benefits of patriarchy to them are just an illusion, and continuing to serve it leaves them with little to no humanity. i catch myself swaying from side to side, humming, crying at a movie or comforting a friend in my arms. these are so natural, so fluid, that i don’t think about them. and then i wonder how men go through life stifling such fundamental needs like freedom of expression, the fostering of community and the appreciation of beauty. they’re always so stiff, eyes blank and soulless. when a woman says something they know they found funny, they stifle that laughter as hard as possible. they seek to meet all their relational needs through sex with women, often becoming detached and compulsive in this pursuit as as it never addresses the hole within them. in its most extreme forms, this pursuit of manhood even causes them to neglect their own health and hygiene because deep down they fear that “caring” as a concept—about anything at all—makes them closer to what they’ve learned to objectify and hate: a woman. 

i went to an all girls’ school from 11-17, so not a lot of interaction with boys during the formative years which is what made this all so starkly evident to me when i started university. none of my male “friendships” (if you can even call them that) survived uni because i just couldn’t get onboard with that creepy, anti human thing they’ve got going on. i did try, because peer pressure or whatnot, but even as friends they’re leeches. they drink you dry for all the emotional support and validation they could never dream of getting from each other, while giving none of that in return and choosing “bro code” over you whenever the opportunity presents itself.

He would accuse her of being ""too ambitious"". Anyway, I looked it up in English media to share here and to my surprise this isn't even news.

One of the workers from the shop we all frequent (the shop that was holding the event) said hello to me as he continued to unload e bikes out of the company van. 

I set my kickstand up and dismounted, ready to introduce myself to the small group of us gathering, when a boy anywhere between 11 and 13 (I coach a youth sport so I am good at guessing)

This boy comes right in my face and chomps at the air making a clacking sound, again, very very close in my personal space. I have never seen this kid in my life. He runs off around the other side of the e bike van, and I walk over there demanding to know why he did that.  He shook his head that yes it was he who did that, he looked ashamed, and answered “I thought it would be funny” sheepishly. 

I said “why? This isn’t a haunted house, it’s a holiday thing, and I’ve never met you in my life. Why would that be funny? Why me? Why did you do that?” He continued to shrug and look down, and his dad said “he’s just a boy” and even walked by me muttering something like I was the bad guy in the situation. I corrected him immediately I said “Tim (fake name), you didn’t see how close it was to my face, it was definitely inappropriate” with confidence and authority. He said he’d take care of it. 

The rest of the whole ride through the decorations I couldn’t believe my first dismount was met at a bullying intimidation tactic off the bat. Followed by some classic darvo.

4bamerica,t2_1cfgot8mch,t3_1hi9jgq,,Living Single Can Set an Example for Other Women,"Too often, we hear heartbreaking stories of women stuck in unhealthy relationships due to societal pressure to be in them. Media, friends, and family often reinforce the idea that women need relationships to feel validated. Most women don't even know that being single is a valid option.

When we live single, we don't just free ourselves, but it creates a ripple effect to help normalize singleness. The more women embrace it, the closer we get to tipping the scales toward singlehood being the norm. There was a study that said by 2030, 45% of women will be single and childless, but why wait this long?

Many women cannot be reached by warnings about men alone, as years of societal conditioning have made them believe their worth is tied to relationships. Sometimes, there's no amount of text or discussion that can convince women of the dangers of men. But if singleness becomes the norm, and it is what women normally see in their day-to-day lives, many will begin to choose it.

Women are often pushed to do things out of socialization. For a long time, this has led to negative consequences. But when women themselves instead of the patriarchy set the standards, sweeping changes can come rapidly. South Korea's birth rates dropped from 1.19 to 0.68 from 2023 to 2024. The same changes are something we can achieve for America.

winterhatcool,t2_vxs5yjqqz,t3_1hicva8,,"Men choose domination (patriarchy) over human connection, then wonder why the people they try to dominate want nothing to do with them ","I had a very interesting interaction with a man recently. So this man was very attracted to me physically and emotionally. As a woman who fits the beauty standards and has spent years working on my personality and character, this is not really surprising. I could look at him and tell he was craving connection and wanted to give in to desire. These are all normal human needs so there is absolutely nothing wrong with having these needs. It’s a beautiful thing to find someone you are naturally drawn to and to want to be intimate with them. And I say this as someone who’s typically not even very much a romantic person.

However I began to notice he seemed desperate to prove he felt nothing for me. As soon as I noticed how he felt, he began to repress his feelings and would deliberately look at me with hatred in his eyes or he would try to neg or shame me by focusing on a particular flaw of mine and staring at it. As a beautiful woman, this experience is sooooo common to me. Men have been taught to seek dominance and subjugation of women, so they feel they lose this dominance when around a woman with whom they feel a connection. And I thought about it and I just felt sad for him. If I personally found a man who fit my ideal physical looks and personality type and he was into me, I wouldn’t run from him. I’d understand that I found something rare and beautiful and I’d cultivate my connection with him. I can’t imagine how spiritually bereft the soul of men like these are. They choose the false promises of patriarchy over their natural human desires and they don’t recognise that their unhappiness starts to make them repulsive . 

Whenever I’ve met men like these, I’ve always ran from them because I can’t stand the dark energy around them. And, despite doing the most to make sure I know they are rejecting me and I’m worthless to them, they get very hurt when I remove myself from them . This hurt is always projected as intense anger towards me and a renewed vigour to harm me as much as they can without going too far, ie physically. 

I believe it’s not just because of my looks, but also my confidence, intelligence, education, experience in life. Men tend to see me as “uppity” and they resent their desire for me. As a result I get a lot of abuse from men even just going out into the public on a daily basis. It does get tiring sometimes but it means I instinctively run when any man close to me in proximity shows even the slightest bit of abuse. 

It’s always interesting that, in general, I ignore men. But these men in closer proximity will try so hard to get my attention only to try to wield rejection against me as a weapon. Typically idgaf cos me noticing you cos you’re constantly staring at me 24/7 does not mean I decided you are my boyfriend. But they are so desperate to harm me through rejection, they’ll take me giving them a look one day as me wanting them, at which point they start the negging and abusing. When they see I’m unbothered, then they get even madder. 

There’s another conversation to be had about how they always tell themselves that my emotional independence is a lie and deep inside I must be easy to manipulate if they dangle their attention and possible connection in front of my face. They have no idea that I am very systematic and logical when choosing a man and I go for a man who is the best for me. 

At this point I’ve been through the same process with so many men, it’s starting to annoy me. They ALL look at me like they’re doing some big manipulative tactic that’s so clever, when they are following the same procedure. It always ends how they don’t expect, which is me choosing my dignity, my sanity, my peace and my self respect over them and the measly attention they are offering. At which point they typically become obsessed, refuse to leave me alone and their inner unhealed child - who has been controlling them this entire time- comes out in full force. 

As a woman who “intimidates” men, I’ve often been able to truly see the worst side of them. I think this is the difference between me and the women who, for instance, marry and have kids with these men only for them to say “he changed so suddenly”. I am privileged that men show me how they truly feel upfront because they hate that they can’t dominate me and, ergo, they hate me. 

After having this experience way too many times, I have to say I pity men. They deny themselves happiness and connection deliberately to hurt women. They have been taught that hurting women will bring them their “masculinity”, so they do so. But deep inside, they end up lonely, cut off from the very connection that would have fed their soul, bereft of true human love and holding the knowledge that the very same women they wanted so much hates their guts. I pity them as I would any other abuser because deep down, they know they are worthless, useless and valueless and that’s why people of value run from them.

Financial independence is the key, I know

I shouldn’t be wasting money on “decorating” myself to look more luxury and pretty for attention 

Now that I think about it… is it a sort of “corset” that our society put on women that they should look pretty and distinguished? 

Buying a house and stocks helps me build my future, but buying jewelry? It is pretty and gives me satisfaction but economically it has little value in it. 

I wonder if it’s a sort of “corset” for women? Or is it natural for women to love diamond and gold? Maybe through movies and dramas our society made me love it? I’m very confused.

Dogtimeletsgooo,t2_12exgk07xm,t3_1hjqsj1,,"""Cat Lady dying alone"", and other ways female liberation is demonized. ","When I was still dating men, it often felt like as soon as we became official I became about 90% of their social life. As an introvert who actually has other things to do and people to see, this always felt incredibly demanding and suffocating to me. I was trying to encourage them to hang out with their other friends, but they very quickly dismissed the importance of those connections. Sometimes they'd want to go hang out with The Boys, but you could still tell they mainly depended on their romantic relationship for most of their emotional support. 

I have a good group of friends, newer and older, and I've been very lucky to nurture those relationships over the years. They're people I genuinely spend holidays with, visit when we're feeling down, and we show up for each other when things get rough as well as for the fun times. I could never make a partner the majority of my social time, I have so many people I want to keep up with and I also enjoy time to myself. 

Men think that we'll die alone, but they only think that because that's what would happen to THEM. Without a woman in their life, their buddies aren't gonna show up enough or in the ways they rely on women to show up. They're not emotionally available to one another the way female friends are to each other, or the way queer folk are available to one another. 

They also know that they need to wife trap a woman so there will always be someone who has to put up with his shit, because friends would eventually get tired of it and leave. It's socially acceptable for friends to dip more than it is for a woman to finally say she's had enough of some mediocre dude. 

Without women, cishet men would have a miserable and lonely existence. And they can only ever see things from their perspective, and don't value anything outside of their own experience, so they can't imagine that actually we're fine without them. 

I was never more lonely than when some man was monopolizing my time and energy. 

How do you nurture relationships apart from a male romantic partner, and how much more can you fill your life with if you're not throwing all your time and energy into a man shaped hole?

BigLibrary2895,t2_69m7yamn,t3_1hjsyy4,,Could Use A Little Uplift,"So yesterday, I received a no cause non-renewal of lease from my landlord. I have until Valentine's Day to find a new place. I have changed careers and while I have a decent job, I've been there less than a year and was unemployed for six months the end of 2023. My credit has fallen precipitously. I was considering using my 401k to consolidate debts but unfortunately now I may need it to get into a new place.

I have decided I want to move into my own place again, as I was living alone before this, and I am contending with how expensive things have become. On paper I am making more money, but rents have increased so much that most places are over 50 to 60% of my net income. 

I am generally a prissy kitty, but I have no criminal record, no history of intravenous drug use, steady rental history, some higher education, and no children. Despite that, I potentially may have to stay on a friend's couch if I can't qualify.

When I talk to people about this, they just say that things might be easier with roommates. It just feels like they are saying I've tried to be too much on my own. I feel like it was allowing myself to rely on others that got me into this situation. Had I stayed by myself in my old apartment, I would have had a shitty apartment, but I wouldn't be int his situation. 

I just feel like I am getting punished, because I won't settle in to be quietly diminished and used by some incubus hobosexual. I may have found a very cheap rental that is only two blocks away from a room I rented at 23. I'm a long way from that young woman, but I just don't feel like it. I feel like this world is just a million ways to make a woman feel small.

BreezyBee55,t2_1ckvyljq5m,t3_1hju3d9,,Request to spread good vibes and hopeful messages ,"With everything that has taken place over the past months, it seems like there’s a common message in media that women are “doomed” with both current and upcoming legislation against us. 

Although, I don’t want to invalidate concerns, feeling scared is a reasonable reaction... I do think these messages are sent to women through media as a way to demoralize us and make us feel like “there’s no hope”

With that said, let’s share  and comment some messages of hope and positivity….



For example: 

- I think 4B is a wonderful opportunity for women to build meaningful lives filled with hobbies and/or a thriving career.

-‘Opting out’ makes opportunities, that better our lives, more attainable and in reach

-Although I believe we are going through dark times, there is so much potential for strong and empowering feminist movements to come out of this ",1734854179.0,,55,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1hju3d9/request_to_spread_good_vibes_and_hopeful_messages/,False

sweetiejen,t2_8g8wxn6h,t3_1hk284p,,Why are unborn children so easy to politicize?,"Because they are a monolith. They are not nuanced, biased, or even remotely distinguishable. It’s easy to politicize them and “advocate” for them because they have no characteristics other than being unborn. It requires no reflective thought to be anti-roe. “Advocating” for the unborn is easy because unlike marginalized or unhoused people you don’t have to contextualize the impact of capitalism when thinking. You don’t have to think about the reality of addiction, persecution, or poverty when being strongly anti-abortion.

I believe most people are anti-abortion because they are stupid. A large majority of those people also hate women and still view us as property. But I can say 100% that they are all incapable of complex reasoning. I believe this to be true for anti-abortion women as well. But it’s always been about a woman’s right to have a life outside of the home. We are not that far in the future from being banned from having our own businesses, credit cards, and homes. They do not want that for us in the US. I live in a blue state with abortion rights enforced into law, but I don’t trust that it will stay that way. 
Don’t rely on your government to protect your rights, because they *will* give them up if they have the chance. And once they do, more rights will surely erode further.

JacquieTorrance,t2_kan9io00x,t3_1hk9tbs,,Intelligence not a factor,"OK ladies I replied recently in a thread in r/Mensa (am a member) to a woman who who said she felt men who rejected her because ""they couldn't handle her intelligence"" was really a sign of respect from them in that they knew they couldn't keep up with her, so it was in some way a tip of the hat to her.

Of course I disagreed. But what surprised me was the result of pointing out reality-  either venom from males, or a kind of mansplaining about how they really do respect women and I just don't get it.

One actually said ""intelligent men don't want to hear feminist talking points like 'the patriarchy.'""

While it was fun for a moment to rile them up the absolute lack of actual consideration and application of intelligence was supremely disappointing.

Women have had bodily autonomy taken away, are dying for medical care and equal research, ffs SC just REintroduced a bill that allows for the execution of women who have abortions. At what point will it be OK to mention it, if precious men forever don't ""want to hear feminist talking points?"" What a ploy.

Well as the old saying goes....evil is defined as ""good"" men who do nothing. Don't count on the ""smart"" ones to care enough to call out other men- any more than the worst offenders. It's really really sad to think that talking about women's rights and equality is something men seem to feel very comfortable spitting on and dismissively declaring ""nobody wants to hear it."" 

I guess I was just taken aback at how even highly intelligent men who can understand science, philosophies and social structures, nevertheless kneejerk respond like someone who doesn't want to lose privilege and use their station to dismiss the reality of the unfairness- and in a way that tells me the reality of inequality never even crosses their mind as something that is real or important to anyone.

My conclusion: much like MAGA, there is little point in discussion, even with the ones who clearly know better. Because they just don't care in the least to give it a single thought.",1734907593.0,,215,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1hk9tbs/intelligence_not_a_factor/,False

Women-only communities, also known as ""womyn's lands"", are intentional communities that were established by lesbian women in the 1960s and 1970s as a way to escape the patriarchy. Some examples of women-only communities include: 
HOWL
A rural retreat in Vermont that was established in 1989. The land was designated for women only by a private donor. 
Fly Away Home
A 40-acre property in Southern Oregon that is part of a larger group of lesbian separatist collectives. 
New Ground
A women-only community where women manage everything themselves, dividing up tasks among teams of volunteers. 
Other women-only communities include: 
Adobeland
Alapine Village
Belly Acres
Cabbage Lane Land Trust
Daughters of the Earth/DOE
Dragon/DW Outpost
Hawk Hill Community Land Trust
Maat Dompim Womyn of Color Land Project
New Mexico Women's Retreat
Some say that women-only communities are at risk of dying out because they are located in remote areas and it's difficult to find people to take over the land. However, others believe that these communities can be inclusive of a wider range of people, including non-binary and queer people.

ConsistentWriting0,t2_5nmth0ii,t3_1hkr1p2,,Holiday and Christmas media that women actually need,"Please feel free to add to this list of entertainment for the holidays that don't center men, or children.

**Movies**

* **Home for the Holidays (1995)** Directed by Jodie Foster, this darkly comedic Thanksgiving-themed movie focuses on a woman navigating her quirky family and finding her own peace.
* **Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey (2020)** This musical celebrates invention, resilience, and joy, with a young girl leading the way to save her grandfather’s legacy. \*This is my top choice\*
* **Last Holiday (2006)** Queen Latifah’s character decides to live boldly after a misdiagnosis. While romance exists, her journey is about self-discovery, luxury, and living life fully.
* **Carol (2015)** While there’s romance, this film’s primary focus is on identity, autonomy, and navigating societal expectations, making it more about empowerment.
* **Frozen (2013)** This animated winter tale is centered on sisterhood and personal growth, with a strong message about independence and self-love.
* **The Fits (2015)** Not strictly holiday-themed, but this atmospheric winter film focuses on a young girl’s self-discovery within a tight-knit female community.
* **Black Christmas (2019)** A feminist horror story about sorority sisters taking charge and banding together against a male-dominated threat during the Christmas season.
* **Little Women (2019)** Not entirely Christmas-focused, but it includes pivotal winter scenes. The film emphasizes individuality, ambition, and female relationships over romance.
* **A Very Murray Christmas (2015)** A quirky holiday special that blends music and comedy, with an ensemble cast led by women like Maya Rudolph and Rashida Jones.
* **Under the Tuscan Sun (2003)** It has a rep as a romance but it's a story about starting over and finding joy in yourself—and set in Italy so you can dream of better weather if it's cold where you are.

# TV Episodes

5. **30 Rock - “Christmas Special” (Season 3, Episode 6)** Liz Lemon - nuff said!
6. **Broad City - “Christmas in July” (Season 3, Episode 10)** A funny, offbeat episode that highlights friendship and individuality.

8. **Frasier - “Merry Christmas, Mrs. Moskowitz” (Season 6, Episode 10)** Roz shines as she deals with her own challenges and supports Frasier in this hilarious holiday episode.
9. **The Mary Tyler Moore Show - “Christmas and the Hard-Luck Kid II” (Season 1, Episode 14)** Mary sacrifices her own holiday plans to help a coworker. The episode emphasizes compassion and selflessness.

  
**Borderline Media:**

These ones may contain some romantic or other themes:

* **The Preacher's Wife (1996)** Whitney Houston shines as a woman balancing her faith and her role in her community during the Christmas season. The romance is understated, with themes of resilience and hope.

All or almost all of that which pertains to love, most straight men reserve exclusively for other men. The people whom they admire, respect, adore, revere, honor, whom they imitate, idolize, and form profound attachments to, whom they are willing to teach and from whom they are willing to learn, and whose respect, admiration, recognition, honor, reverence and love they desire… those are, overwhelmingly, other men. In their relations with women, what passes for respect is kindness, generosity or paternalism; what passes for honor is removal to the pedestal. From women they want devotion, service and sex.

Heterosexual male culture is homoerotic; it is man-loving.”

- Marilyn Frye

Most male culture is homoerotic and most men don’t really like women as people but as objects to fulfill their sexual/personal desires.

Dogtimeletsgooo,t2_12exgk07xm,t3_1hn3i0c,,Requesting a female therapist,"I am looking for a new therapist to start building a rapport with, because I know I'll probably need someone to talk to as I finish this nursing degree. I've got some amount of PTSD and a ton of adhd, so it just feels like I'll need one eventually and I want to get all the catch up done before then. 

I didn't really specify any gender when I requested an appointment, thinking it didn't matter. The appointment was with someone who reminded me of my old late psychology professor, whomst was very chill and insightful. Looked just like him, sounded just like him, etc. So I think I was primed to give him more leeway than I otherwise would've. 

Anyway, as I'm speedrunning my tragic backstory for him so he's got a basic outline, I get to the point where I tell him about a former friend who likely drugged and assaulted me. This person led me to believe it was my fault and actually I was the bad guy for leading THEM on even though I couldn't even sit up, and I was so unprepared to confront the fact that I'd been betrayed in that way, so I just victim blamed myself. I let this person push me into a relationship for almost a year because I thought that was all I deserved, etc. 

Anyway this was all very traumatic, and eventually I regained my senses and told them I knew what they did was wrong and they could get fucked. I was not able to get enough evidence to do anything about it, he made sure I went to the bathroom etc the morning after, and kept the guilt on me until it was too late. 

And the therapist was naturally surprised I stayed with this person, but his comment really stuck with me. 

""So you were a sex toy."" 

I got a bit of delayed processing over here, but even in that moment I was like- uhhhh do we know each other well enough for that kind of comment yet? 

I just moved along through the appointment, but I've been thinking about it since. I was wondering if I should bring it up at our next appointment, or if I should just confront the next time something feels off. 

But honestly, I'm just going to call and request a female therapist. Idk if I'll make a complaint or even how to do that, but it feels really irresponsible to make such a blunt comment to someone you don't know very well yet about something traumatic like that. If I'd been less stable that might have really set me off, if it had been more recent, etc. 

Plus I just don't want to spend MY therapy time slot trying to tell a man how to do his job better. I'm not afraid to tell him why I'm changing therapists, but I just don't want to waste more time and money to do it. 

I'm going to ask for female therapists and doctors from now on, right from the start. They aren't automatically Good but I think there's at least a better chance that they're not low key asking more probing questions about my sexual trauma for some weird interest, or totally underestimating the trauma of it entirely. I'm trying to find someone I can build rapport with so I can rely on them and feel safe with them as things get harder, I don't have time to waste putting up with bad vibes. 

Plus, guys aren't typically emotionally intelligent anyway, so I would rather go with someone who's grown up learning that. 

Does anyone here go out of their way to request female professionals now? ",1735262741.0,,142,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1hn3i0c/requesting_a_female_therapist/,False

kitobich,t2_dneyztoq,t3_1ho71se,,The Irreparable Damage of Patriarchy on Romantic Dynamics Between Men and Women in Western Society,"An essay from my point of view.

**Introduction**  
The romantic dynamics between men and women in Western society have been profoundly shaped—and irreparably damaged—by the structures and values of patriarchy. From domestic labor inequities and financial imbalances to cultural pressures to conform to traditional gender roles, patriarchy has entrenched power dynamics that foster resentment, dependence, and disconnection between genders. Attempts to navigate these dynamics within the confines of patriarchal norms often lead to further complications, such as contentious custody arrangements, the double burden on women, and the psychological toll of unequal partnerships. In contrast, matriarchal systems, where relationships and family structures are free from the rigid entanglements of patriarchy, offer a compelling alternative. This essay argues that patriarchal values and structures have irreparably damaged the potential for healthy, equal, and caring relationships between men and women in Western society. By exploring the inequities of domestic life, the impact of financial dependence, the persistence of patrilineal systems, and the alternatives found in matriarchal societies, we will uncover the ways in which these dynamics are permanently skewed.

**Patriarchy and the Division of Labor**  
One of the clearest manifestations of patriarchy in heterosexual romantic relationships is the disproportionate burden of domestic labor and childcare on women. In Western societies, even among couples who claim to value equality, women consistently perform more unpaid domestic work. This inequity is not incidental but structural: it reflects centuries of conditioning that places the responsibilities of home and family on women, while men are associated with public, paid labor. Statistics from the *OECD Better Life Index* show that women in Western countries perform nearly twice as much unpaid labor as men. This disparity is particularly pronounced after couples cohabit or have children. While men may initially participate more equally in tasks during early stages of a relationship, the burden often shifts overwhelmingly to women, especially in traditional family structures. This imbalance leads to resentment on the part of women, who feel unsupported and overworked, and defensiveness from men, who may feel criticized for not meeting expectations.

Moreover, as men take on more caregiving roles in response to societal pressures for gender equality, the dynamics of dependence grow more complex. Men often view their contributions as equal when they do the ""visible"" tasks, such as playing with children or handling occasional chores, while the ""invisible"" mental and emotional labor—coordinating schedules, maintaining household harmony, managing school requirements—remains with women. This disparity creates a psychological chasm, making it difficult for either partner to feel truly appreciated or understood.

**Financial Dependence and Gender Inequality**  
The gender pay gap is another pillar of patriarchy that exacerbates the imbalance between men and women in relationships. Despite decades of advocacy, women still earn less than men for equivalent work across most industries. This economic disparity forces many women into financial dependence on their male partners, reducing their autonomy and increasing their vulnerability in cases of divorce, domestic abuse, or relationship breakdowns. Financial dependence creates a power dynamic that can be difficult to overcome. Women may feel they must conform to their partner’s wishes or prioritize their partner’s career over their own to maintain household stability. Men, in turn, may develop feelings of entitlement or dominance, consciously or unconsciously reinforcing traditional roles where they are the ""providers"" and women the ""dependents.""

**Patrilineal Lineage and Custody Struggles**  
Patriarchal society’s insistence on patrilineal lineage- where children are viewed as extensions of their father’s legacy -further complicates male-female dynamics. This focus ties women to men through shared children, perpetuating dependence and limiting women’s autonomy. Custody battles in Western societies exemplify this issue, as fathers increasingly claim equal rights to children even in situations where this arrangement disadvantages the mother and child. The demand for ""equal"" custody, while ostensibly fair, often fails to consider the natural and emotional stability children derive from having a central home or base. Splitting children’s time equally between parents fragments their sense of security and places additional burdens on mothers, who frequently remain the default caregivers even in shared custody arrangements. This insistence on fathers’ rights is less about the well-being of the child and more about maintaining patriarchal control over women and family structures.

In contrast, matriarchal societies such as the Mosuo people of China offer a different paradigm. In their system, children are raised within the maternal family, with uncles or other male relatives serving as father figures rather than biological fathers. This structure eliminates the need for contentious custody battles and allows children to grow up in stable, unfragmented households. Women retain their independence, and relationships with men are based on mutual affection and choice, rather than the necessity of co-parenting or financial dependency.

**Cultural Conditioning and the Cycle of Patriarchal Norms**  
Despite the progress made by feminist movements, women in so-called egalitarian countries remain culturally compelled to seek traditional domestic relationships. The nuclear family, with its emphasis on cohabitation, shared finances, and child-rearing, continues to dominate societal expectations. Women who choose alternative lifestyles (such as remaining single, child-free, or pursuing communal living arrangements) often face stigma or social alienation. Even in countries like Sweden, where progressive policies support gender equality, studies reveal that women still take on a disproportionate share of housework and childcare. This persistence of inequality reflects the deeply ingrained nature of patriarchal norms, which prioritize men’s careers and public roles while relegating women to domestic spheres.

The dissatisfaction many women feel in these traditional setups is evident in cultural trends. In Japan, for instance, straight women increasingly gravitate toward *BL (boys’ love)* manga -romantic stories featuring male protagonists in same-sex relationships. These narratives allow women to imagine idealized emotional connections free from the burdens and imbalances of heterosexual relationships. The inability to even project a healthy, equal relationship between men and women in fantasy highlights the pervasive disillusionment with patriarchal norms.

**The Permanently Damaged Dynamics**  
The cumulative effects of patriarchy on romantic relationships are profound and likely irreversible. The unequal division of labor, financial dependence, patrilineal systems, and cultural pressures create an environment where resentment, disconnection, and emotional dissatisfaction are almost inevitable. Attempts to reform these dynamics - through policy changes, education, or shifts in social attitudes - often fail to address the root causes embedded in patriarchal structures. For example, while equal pay initiatives aim to reduce financial dependence, they do little to address the unpaid labor imbalance that women face at home. Similarly, progressive parental leave policies are often underutilized by men, leaving women as the primary caregivers. These incremental reforms may alleviate some symptoms of patriarchy, but they cannot dismantle the underlying system that perpetuates inequality.

**Conclusion**  
The romantic dynamics between men and women in Western society have been irreparably damaged by patriarchy. The structural inequities, power imbalances, and cultural conditioning inherent in patriarchal systems prevent men and women from relating on a truly equal and caring level. Alternative models, such as those found in matriarchal societies, highlight the possibility of healthier relationships based on independence and choice. However, the deeply entrenched nature of patriarchal norms makes it unlikely that Western societies will adopt such models on a large scale. Until these systems are dismantled, men and women will continue to navigate relationships fraught with inequality, resentment, and disconnection. The damage caused by patriarchy is not only personal but societal, leaving generations trapped in cycles of dysfunction. The path forward requires not only reimagining relationships but fundamentally restructuring the values and systems that govern them, a task that seems increasingly insurmountable in the face of entrenched patriarchal dominance.",1735397108.0,,137,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1ho71se/the_irreparable_damage_of_patriarchy_on_romantic/,False

RipUnable1245,t2_skqd8zuby,t3_1hoalx5,,**THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION WAS NEVER FEMINIST; IT WAS ALWAYS PATRIARCHAL**  ,"Good afternoon, everyone. I want to talk about a topic that has been misrepresented and glorified for decades: the sexual revolution. For years, we were told that this so-called revolution brought freedom to women, that we broke free from the chains of sexual repression, and that we finally achieved equality in the bedroom. But the reality is far different: the sexual revolution was hijacked by the patriarchy, turning it into a tool of control disguised as emancipation. And at the heart of this narrative lies a deeply rooted deception.

The dominant narrative tells us that the sexual revolution allowed us to break free from taboos and live out our sexuality freely. But here’s the big lie: this “liberation” wasn’t designed for us—it was designed for men. Under this framework, women were pushed into the role of being “sexually available,” but only on terms dictated by the patriarchy.

Let’s think about the cultural dynamics this revolution reinforced. Male pleasure remained at the center, while female pleasure was reduced to a means of validating men. Women didn’t gain autonomy; they gained a new kind of pressure: to be “liberated” according to someone else’s standards. Don’t want to participate? You’re a prude. Participate, and your body and desire become objects of consumption. There was no real space for autonomy—it was a carefully disguised trap.

This brings us to Playboy. Hefner, with his silk robe and his rhetoric about sexual freedom, positioned himself as a supposed revolutionary. But if we really examine his legacy, what we find is a business built on exploiting women’s image.

Playboy didn’t liberate anyone. What it did was turn female sexuality into a product, packaged and sold to the highest bidder. The famous “bunnies” weren’t empowered women—they were pieces of a system dictating how women needed to look in order to be desired and valued. Young, thin, heteronormative, always ready to please.

And by the way, can someone explain to me why men aren’t “sexually liberated” (at least not in the same way)? Why don’t they liberate themselves by stripping down?

And yes, I know the sexual revolution wasn’t created by Hefner, and I understand that many women were involved in it at the beginning. That’s why I clarified that it was hijacked for male desire and disguised as feminist. There’s even an HBO documentary about Hefner where he’s referred to as a feminist.",1735407198.0,,623,0,post,https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/comments/1hoalx5/the_sexual_revolution_was_never_feminist_it_was/,False

Christine Carpenter (circa 1332) famously left her cell and promptly requested to return to her cell. And Julian of Norwich (who had a man’s name but was very much female), born in 1342, remained in her cell and went on to write a book entitled “Revelations of Divine Love.” This was the first book ever written in English by a woman. Bad. Ass.

NeverendingStormy,t2_1fkwpt5q7e,t3_1hpp69k,,It makes me angry to see women all excited about getting married.,"Just a vent. I see a lot of stuff on TV etc. about weddings and how women are so ecstatic when he ""pops the question"". They act like it's the best thing that ever happened or could happen to them. They believe so much in the fairy tale idea and think that a male marrying them is somehow validating their existence as a woman in this world. Like they suddenly became fully human and were lacking before.

It makes me so angry and sad to know that these women are just going to be used for sex and cleaning. They will be cheated on, they will have no choices, and they will end up supporting the male while he plays video games and demands deviant and disgusting sex acts and threatens to leave if she doesn't do what he wants.

I also feel some anger at the whole wedding industry and how many people profit from this degradation of women. How much money women put into this one day, how much time and effort and labor. 

The men do nothing. They rent a tux (if they even bother doing that) and show up. Then they fill their vows with shit about sex and shove their wife's face into a cake while laughing at her.

I hope women begin to understand that marriage isn't a completion of your self, but a taking away from yourself. That's how I see it. 

The worst of it is the ""bridezilla"" idea where women also get so abusive to other women about ""their day"" and want everyone to devote their entire existences to this woman's wedding day as if it is the one day out of their whole life that everyone has to be their personal servant. Women treat other women so very badly when it comes to their wedding.

Own_Junket1605,t2_7ipf8vtt,t3_1hq8717,,working with men,"So, I work at a pre-seed tech startup that is almost completely filled with men(90%). They're only 3 women out of 22 members and the other is leaving soon so it'll be just 2 of us. And the other girl is fully remote because she's not in the city, so when I have to come in for work sessions and meetings, it's just me and 13 to 16 other men. It's pretty suffocating.

There's a huge part of me that wants to leave, I'm not having a great time. I've worked pretty hard and I get paid by project. I'm the one applying for funding, managing social media and also building our web app (most of my team are data scientists and engineers, I'm the only one with front-end experience), and also a product manager of sorts. 

However, our founder still acts like I'm not doing enough work? And a little rant, I wish I could stand up for myself more. He has a terrible habit of being touchy and trying to take me out (he doesn't do this to others) and trying to be flirty even though he has a girlfriend. Hes the type of guy that sees himself a 'HIGH VALUE MALE' and thinks every woman should be head over heels for him. I've mentioned it a few times, but probably not as confidently as I should have. Also, he's 13 years older than me (ew)

I own a sizable equity in the company, but I'm very worried about being voted off if I leave right now (per our contract). But I'm a little tired of working there. I've had way worse experiences so I keep telling myself this isn't too bad, plus I could eventually get a good payout if I stick along for a bit. Also, the tech scene just sucks so terribly right now, and even though I believe I can find something else, I may take a pay cut AND lose part of my equity.
